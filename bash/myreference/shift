shift is a shell builtin that operates on the positional parameters.
Each time you invoke shift, it "shifts" all the positional parameters down by one.
$2 becomes $1, $3 becomes $2, $4 becomes $3, and so on. Try this:

#!/bin/bash

echo "You start with $# positional parameters"

# Loop until all parameters are used up
while [ "$1" != "" ]; do
  echo "Parameter 1 equals $1"
  echo "You now have $# positional parameters"

  # Shift all the parameters down by one
  shift

done
