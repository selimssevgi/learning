# starch

- examples
  - crackers
  - white bread
  - potatoes
  - corn
  - rice
  - pasta

- plants mostly store for energy in roots and seeds

- glocose molecules are joined together by alpha linkages
  - can be easily cleaved by enzymes in digestive tract

- when starch is cooked, the digestibility is increased

## resistant starch

- fibers can trap some starches preventing them from being cleaved
