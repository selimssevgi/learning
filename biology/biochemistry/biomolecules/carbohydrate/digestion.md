# digestion of carbohydrate

- small intestine breaks down complex to simple building blocks

- when you eat carbohydrate-rich food, sugar level in your blood goes up

- digestive tract does not respond to all carbohydrates the same

- polysaccharides(starch and fiber)

- starches(white bread, cracker) digested easily, bunch of glucose
  - same effect as drinking something high in glucose like soda
