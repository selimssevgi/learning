# lipids

- are a group of hydrophobic(non-polar) biomolecules
- are insoluble in water

- primary function is long-term energy storage

- also used for protection

* there are 4 basic categories of lipids

1. triglycerides
2. phospholipids
3. steroids
4. waxes

## triglycerides

* fats(buttur)
- solid at room temperature
- used by animals for isolation and protection
- saturated fatty acid

* oils(olive, corn oil)
- liquid at room temperature
- used by plants for long-term energy storage
- unsaturated fatty acid

## phospholipids

- glycerol + 2 fatty acids
- phosphate group makes the head hydrophilic

- plasma membranes

## steroids
