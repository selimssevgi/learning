# proteins

- building block of proteins is amoni acid

- adjacent amoni acids are held together with covalent bonds

- peptide bond cannot rotate freely

- 20 different amoni acids - 20 side chain
  - polar, uncharged
  - polar, charged(-)
  - polar, charged(+)
  - hydrophobic
  - special (glycine, proline, cysteine)

- the function of many proteins rely on their 3D shapes
- 3D shapes of proteins determine their function
  - defense (antibody)
  - transport (calcium-pump)
  - communication (insulin)
  - storage (ferritin)
  - enzyme
  - structure (collagen)

### factors effecting protein structure

- heat: breaking the bonds
- ph: effecting electrostatic interactions
- other molecules
