# chemistry for biology

- there are 6 major elements we need to know in biology

* sponch

## bonds

- covalend bonds (80 kcal/mol)
  - non-polar (C-C, C-H)
  - polar(C-O, O-H, N-H)

- non-covalend bonds
  - hydrogen bonds(5 kcal/mol) - a polar hydrogen in one, O or N in another
  - ionic bonds
  - van der waals (1 kcal/mol)

element     | max bonds | electronegativity
----------------------------------------------
hydrogen    | 1         | 2.2
oxygen      | 2         | 3.4
nitrogen    | 3 (4)     | 3.0
carbon      | 4         | 2.5
phosphorus  | 5         | 2.1
sulfur      | 6         | 2.5


* valence shell: the outermost shell contains valence electrons

* an electrons valance: the number of electrons needed to satisfy the octet rule

- atoms with full valence shell are not reactive (no need more electrons)

## electronegativity

- an atom's ability to attract electrons to itself when bonded to another atom

- oxygen and nitrogen are more electronegative than carbon and hydrogen

* elements does not share shared elements equally, some can be greedier
  - electronegativity

- N and O have most electronegativity than other 4, bonds with those two are usually polar

## polarity of molecules

- C-H has electrons equally shared(non-polar)

- O-H has electrons NOT-equally shared, they are a bit closer to O, so it is polar
  - O is partially negatively charged
  - H is partially positively charged
