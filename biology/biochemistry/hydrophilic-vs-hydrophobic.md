# hydrophilic vs hydrophobic

- cell membrane

## water

- H2O is a polar molecule
- shared electrons are closer to oxygen
- oxygen is partially negatively charged
- hydrogen is partially positvely charged


## hydrophopic molecules

- non-polar: no charges, so it wont interact with water

- interact with other neutral molecules, and non-polar solvents

- form clusters in water

- examples:
  - alkanes
  - oils
  - fats

- lipophilic

## hydrophilic molecules

- polar

- interact with water and other polar substances

- capable of forming hydrogen bonds

- some hydrophilic substances do not dissolve in water

- examples:
  - salts
  - sugars
