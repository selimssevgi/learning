# polar vs non-polar molecules

- +-+-  => neutral
- +     => ion (positvely charged)
- -     => ion (negatively charged)
- +  -  => neutral but polarized

## polar molecules (unequal sharing)

* hydrogen bond
  - H20, NH3, HF, CH3OH

## non-polar molecules (equal sharing)

* mono or a diatomic atoms:
  - mono: He, Ne, Ar
  - di: N2, O2, F2,

* only carbon and hydrogen molecules:
  - CH4, C2H6
