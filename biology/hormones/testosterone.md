# testosterone

- testosterone is produced in the testes, but a small amount comes from the adrenal cortex

- levels of testosterone rise dramatically during puberty, then remain at a high level

- two key hormones:
  - LH: is responsible for stimulating the production of testosterone in the testis
  - FSH: contributes to the production of sperm
  - they both report back to the brain if producing enough

- there is little hard evidence pointing to a link between increased levels of testosterone and aggressive behavior

- testosterone can be identified and measured in various bodily fluids including:
  - saliva
  - urine
  - blood
