# atomic structure


* why negatively charged and posivetely charged particals stay away from each other?
- coulomb's force law: attraction and repulsion
- when r=distance is infinite, there will no be force
- when r=distance is zero, infinitely attractive

* if the electron and the nucleus are infinitely attracted, why do they stay apart?

-  coulomb's law only describes force as a function of r (distance)
- does NOT tell us how r changes with time

- newton's second law: Force = mass x acceleration
- based on the calculation, two particles should come together too fast

- so what is wrong here? why dont they come together?

- the laws of *classical mechanics* no longer work at this size scale!

- quantum mechanics provides a single and comprehensive theory that explains the
  behavior of matter on an atomic (nonameter or smaller) scale
