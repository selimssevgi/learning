# energy level

- binding energy = R-constant / n^2

- all binding energies are negative

- n -> being levels

- n = 1, is the lowest state, most stable state, ground state

## ionization energy (IE)

- binding energy = -IE

- IE is always positive (binding energy is always negative)

- electron is bound more weakly when n is big

## verification of hydrogen atom energy levels

1. photon emission
  - electron transtions from the higher to the lower E state
  - a photon is emitted that has the same energy as the energy diff between two states
2. photon absorption

## energy levels

- 7 eV level = third excited state
- 6 eV level = second excited state
- 4 eV level = first excited state
- 0 eV level = ground state

- electrons cannot exist between energy levels

- for an electron to get to a higher energy level, we have to give the electron more energy

- how to give an electron energy: shoot light at it

- if a photon of the right energy can strike an electron, the electron will
  absorb all the photon's energy and jump to a higher energy level
  - from ground state to 1st excited state: a photon with 4eV is needed
  - during absorbtion the photon(light) will dissapear

- electrons want to go back to ground state(lowest energy)

- our electron will fall down and give up 4 eV energy by emitting a photon

- we need exactly the amount of energy in one of the energy level
  - photon with 5 eV will just pass through
  - electron either absorb all of the photon's energy or none of it

- if you were shine light that consisted of all possible wavelengths through a
  gas, all the wavelength would not make it through
