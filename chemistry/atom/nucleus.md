## nucleus (1911): gold foil experiment

## discovery

- send alpha particles -> detector (got ~132.000)

- send alpha particle -> gold foil -> detector (got ~132.000)

- send alpha particle -> gold foil -> detector (got ~132.000)
- detecter (got around ~20)

- gold atoms are mostly empty(mostly passing through),
- there is something in the middle that particles are bouncing back
- they call this thing as *nucleus*
