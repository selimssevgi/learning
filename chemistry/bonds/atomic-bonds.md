# atomic bonds

## covalent bond

- are the strongest bonds, they create stable molecules

### single covalent bonds

- involve the sharing of one pair of electrons

- hydrogen has a valence of 1 & 1 valence electron
  - hydrogen has one shell, and 1 electron

- 2 Hydrogen comes together and share 1 electron of each other, both satisfied

### double covalent bonds

- involve the sharing of two pairs of electrons (stronger)

- oxygen has 6 valence electronns, need 2 electrons for octet rule

- can do that sharing 2 electrons with another oxygen

### triple covalent bonds

- nitrogen (stronger but rare)

## ionic bonds

- are weaker and less stable, but still abide by the octet rule

- common table salt (NaCi) is formed from ionic bonds

- first ions are formed, then the ions are attracted by their opposite charge

- Na has 1 valence electron - could lose 1 (easy) and gain 7 (difficult)
- Ci has 7 valence electron - could gain 1 (easy) and lose 7 (difficult)

## hydrogen bonds

- sound strong but they are the weakest of the three bonds

- water - H2O, oxygen needs 2 more electrons

- binds covalently with 2 hydrogens

- water is a polar molecule
  - oxygen is more electronegative
  - unequal sharing of electrons creates polarity
