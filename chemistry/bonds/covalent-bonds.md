# covalent bonds

- atoms become more stable when together than when they are apart

- a pair of electrons *shared* between 2 atoms 

- *dissociation energy*: required to separate bonded atoms, indicates bond stregnth


## polar covalent bond

- an *unequal sharing* of electrons between two atoms with different electronegativities

- different of > 0.4 and < 1.7 (pauling scale) is considered polar covalent
