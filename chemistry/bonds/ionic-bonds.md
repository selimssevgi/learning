# ionic bonds

- why does a metal gives away one of its electrons?

- connect metals and non-metals
  - AgCl
  - MgI2
  - Al2O3

- involve complete transfer of (1 or many) electrons between two atoms

- bonding results from the electrostatic attraction between the cation and anion

- NaCi

- Na -> Na+ + e

- Cl + e -> Cl-

- the formation of the ions from neutral atoms has a positive delta-energy
- it requires energy

## NaCl (sodium chloride)

- start with separate atoms (metal atom, non-metal atom)

- sodium gives an electron to chlorine
  - Na becomes +, lost 1 electron
  - Cl becomes -, gain 1 electron

- atoms get a charge and become ions

- ions have opposite charges so they stick together
