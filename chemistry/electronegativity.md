# electronegativity

- a measure of how badly an atom wants electrons

- net ability of an atom to attract an electron from another atom

- an atom with a high electronegativity is an electron acceptor because it has a high affinity for electrons

- high electronegativity -> electron acceptor (non-metal)
- low electronegativity -> electron donor (metals)
