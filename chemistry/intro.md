# intro

## atomic structure

- atoms consists of
  - protons: has mass, in the middle
  - neutrons: has mass, in the middle
  - electrons: almost no mass, orbits around

- protons and neutrons are in nucleus

- the number of protons defines the element

- atomic number: protons alone

- atomic mass: protons + neutrons

* isotopes: varying number of neutrons

- carbon-12: 6 protons + 6 neutrons
- carbon-13: 6 protons + 7 neutrons
- carbon-14: 6 protons + 8 neutrons


* ions: varying number of electrons

## chemical behavior

- why do chemicals interact?

- because of their electron arrangements 

- when chemicals interact, they often gain or lose electrons


## energy shells (level)

- electrons arranged in shells around nucleus

- first shell has 2 electrons (s-orbital only)


* excited state: if energy is added electrons can move up in energy level
* ground state: as they return to original state, they relese energy
