# nobel gases

- group 18 elements

- He - Helium - fills balloon, airships, less dense than air, floats
- Ne - Neon  - electrical current causes bright orange light
- Ar - Argon - lightbulbs
- Kr - Krypton - lasers, flat-panel display, isolation
- Xe - Xenon - car headlights to increase road safety, medicine
- Rn - Radon - radiotherapy


- nobel gases all have full valence shells

- they are so stable

- nobel gases are colorless

## helium

- heavier than hydrogen, but more stable

- baloon with hydrogen with a match, will get a bright flame
- baloon with helium with a match, will just burn just sound, cus unreactive 

- cooling helium, it will slow down, and just sit on the ground
- helium getting back to normal temp, it will start to move, fly to ceiling

## xenon

- heavy gas
- baloon with xenon goes will fall on the ground

- it is expensive

## radon

- could cause lung cancer
