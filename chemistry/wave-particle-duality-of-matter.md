# wave-particle duality of matter; schrondinger equation

1. light as a particle
  - the photoelectric effect
  - photon momentum

2. matter as a wave

3. the schrodinger equation


* the energy of an incoming photon must be equal to or greater than the (work
  function) of the metal in order to eject an electron

* three photons, each with an energy equal to WF/2 will NOT eject an electron


- red light
- UV light

## photon momentum

- if light is a stream of particles, each of those particles must have a momentum

## matter as a wave

- why dont we observe the wave-like behavior of matter in day-to-day activities?

- wave-length of a thrown small ball: 1.1 x 10^-32 m, undetectably small

- 1925 diffraction pattern from electrons (wavelike property)


- 1906 - nobel price J.J.Thomson(father):  showed that an electron is a particle
- 1937 - nobel price G.P.Thomson(son)   :  showed that an electron is wave


* why do we care today about special properties of small things?
* why do we care energy levels?
* why do we care of quantum mechanics?

- quantom dots

## schrodinger equation

- is an equation of motion for particles (like electrons) that account for their wave-like properties

- the schrodinger equation is to quantom mechanics like netwon's equations of motion are to classical mechanics

- electrons are moving around nucleus
- equations is in 3 dimension
- equations changes based on the location of electron, which we will not know exactly


- solving schrodinger equation means:
  - finding E, binding energy of electron to nucleus

- binding energy = R-constant / n^2

- n = 1, 2, 3... infinity = principal quantum

- binding energies are quantiezed!

- principal quantum comes out schrodinger eqaution
