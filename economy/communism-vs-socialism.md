# communism vs socialism

* two have in common:
  - limit worker exploitation
  - eliminate economic classes




- whoever owns the factory or farm is getting more out of the worker than they are putting in
  - owner/bourgeoisie: has power over the worker
  - workers/proletariat

- society must shift towards a model:
  - where the proletariat hold his power instead by collectively controlling the
    means of production


- socialism is a precursor to communism and the next logical step after capitalism

- in socialism, a democratic state controls the means of production rather than
  having private companies hold ownership
