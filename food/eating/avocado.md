# avocado

### shopping

- the skin is nice and dark black

- make sure that is a nice push to it

- the button up should push in very easily

- if it is too smushy, it is probably bad

- take out the button, and make sure the color in the is not brown

### storage

- store it out of refrigerator, inside a bowl

### usage

- once you cut the avocado, put lemon/lime on it to keep it from getting brown
