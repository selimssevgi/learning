# intermittent fasting

- not a diet, a meal timing plan 

- not eating for 16 hours of the days

- gives the body time to deplete the giycogen stores and start burning fat

- 16 no-eating, 8 hours eating

- one day on, one day off

- lowers insulin - the fat storing hormone involved with diabetes
- raises human growth hormone

- it is not the longer you dont eat, the hungrier you get
- body adapts itself to eating times, and you get hungry before eating times

### before starting the fast

- consume high fiber meal prior to starting the fast
  - some vegetables
  - you will not get stomach growls

- little bit of fat, fiber, and protein

### during the fast

- black coffee (not milk or sugar)

- black/green tea (no sweeteners)

- water

### how to break fast

- bone broth (kemik suyu)

- do not mix fat with carbs
  - carbs cause an insulin spike
  - insulin cause cells be more receptive
  - cells gets fat

- carbs and protein
- fats and protein

### when should work out

- in the morning
  - you still have strength to work out

- right before breaking fast
  - will cause more fat burning
  - cus of fasting, may not have so much strength for work-out

- after breaking fast
  - not so good, as it will cause not to digest the food in its usual way
  - the blood will be used for other purposes as well


### insulin

- when you eat, insulin goes up

- insulin helps you utilize carbohydrate for energy, or stores it as glycojen,
  which is basically linked chains of glucose

- glycogen is stored in the liver or muscle
- when you have too much glycogen, the incoming carbohydrate will be stored as fat

- different foods will give a different insulin rise
  - fat stimulates insulin a minimal amount
  - carbs provoke massive rises in insulin

- insulin's job is to help you absorb and store nutrients

- after about four to six hours after you eat, insulin levels will have gone down
- glucose level in your blood starts to decrease
- this prompts the pancreas to secrete glucagon

- glucagon has almost the opposite function of insulin

- insulin stores food energy, but glucagon pulls that energy out from your
  glycogen stores and your fat stores

### benefits
