# lemon

### shopping

- make sure that is has a nice bright color

- make sure that its skin has a slight push to it all the way around

- make sure that it is very, very tender, that means there is juice in there

- avoid the ones having brown spots

- you can also smell your lemon and make sure it has that nice vibrant lemony smell to it


### storage

- store your lemons in a dry place, not inside of refrigerator

### usage

- before you cut lemons, you can press and roll on them on your counter, and you
  should yield more juice
