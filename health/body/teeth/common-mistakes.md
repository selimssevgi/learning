# common mistakes

- dont brush for long enough (at least 2 mins)

- brushing too often (can damage)

- brushing too soon after eating (at least after 30 mins)

- brushing with too much pressure

- brushing without the right technique

- using an old toothbrush (either after 3 months or looks wore off) 

- using too much toothpaste (pea sized amount is enough)

- rinsing after brushing (spit but not rinse, so toothpaste can do its job)

- not flossing (at least once a day before brushing)

- forgetting to clean your tongue
