# death

- philosophy as a training for death - plato

- the philosopher does not fear death, becuase he comtemplates the totality of time and of being

- though one can go to his death for another, such 'dying-for' can never signify
  that the other has had his death taken away in even the slightest degree. no
  one can take the other's death away from him - heidegger
