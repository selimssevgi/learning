# escape

- in the mentality of modern historians, there is no cliche more firmly
  anchored, and more difficult to uproot, than the idea according to which:

- ancient philosophy was an escape mechanism, an act of falling back upen oneself:
  - platonist, it was an escape into the heaven of ideas,
  - epicureans, it was an escape into the refusal of politics
  - stoics, it was an escpae into the submission to fate
