# aristotle's metaphysics

- opinion vs knowledge

- apperance vs reality

- plato uses dialogs, telling likely stories, like a science
- aristotle is like literature, detailed analysis, succient, systematic
  - he has an objective air of an scientist, detached from historical concern

- a bit hard to read, he had to develop his own terminology



- knowledge
  - practical (action, productive, instrumental value(has a value to reach smth else))
    - experience (memory, kwowing what is around/happening)
    - art (knowing how to make smth)
  - teoritical (understanding/knowing the truth, instrinsic value(a value in itself))
    - sciences (particular(social, natural) sciences)
    - first wisdom (metaphysics, science of (doing) science, science of being)
