# rene descartes

- he doubted everything, and that was the only thing he was certain of.

- intuitive certainty with which he suddenly perceives himself as a thinking thing

- is there anything more he could perceive with the same intuitive certainty?
  - an idea he had always had, and it was thus self-evident to descartes that
    such an idea could not possible have come from himself
  - god exists was therefore just as self-evident for him as that a thinking being must exist

- descartes believed like socrates and plato that there is a connection between reason and being

- meditations most influencial
  - I doubt

- discourse on method

- clear and distinct

- intuition
  - aware of our thoughts

- natural light of reason

- objective vs formal reality

- i think(conscious), therefore i exist
  - how about the times I am not conscious?
  - memory?

- thinking thing => soul
  - why not it is a body? (materialism)
