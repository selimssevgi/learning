# dialectic process

- as soon as one thought is proposed
- it will be contradicted by another
- a tension arises between two opposite ways of thinking
- but the tension is resolved by the proposal of a third thought which
  accommodates the best of both points of view

- three stages of knowledge:

1. thesis
2. antithesis
3. synthesis

- eleatics claimed that change was in fact impossible
- heraclitus said everything flows
- empedocles pointed out that both claims partly right and wrong

- descartes rationalism
- hume's empirical antithesis
- kant's synthesis


- being
- nothing
- becoming (both it is and it is not)


- hegel's reason is thus dynamic logic
- since reality is characterized by opposites, a description of reality must
  therefore also be full of opposites
