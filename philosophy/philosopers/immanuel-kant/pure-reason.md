# a critique of pure reason

- kant adopts the standpoint of his predecessors, the dogmatic philosopers

- shares the following assumptions with them:

1. metaphysics is the science of what lies beyond the possibility of all experience
2. this can never be discovered using principles that are themselves derived
   from experience, rather only what we know prior to, and thus *independently* of
   all experience can beyond possible experience
3. some principles of this kind are really to be found within our reason, and
   they are comprehended under the term 'cognition from pure reason'

- at this point he parts ways:

* his predecessors says:
  - thiese principles, or cognition from pure reason, are expressions of the
    absolute possibility of things, eternal truths, sources of ontology, they
    stand above the worldorder as fate stood above the gods of the ancients

* kant says:
  - these are meer forms of our intellect, laws that do not concern the
    existince of things but rather our representations of them, thus, they are
    valid only for our apprehension of things and cannot extend further than the
    possibility of experience
