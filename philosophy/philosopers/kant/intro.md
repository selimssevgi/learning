# immanuel kant

- both professor and philoshoper

- time and space are first and foremost modes of perception and not attributes or the physical world

- mind is not just passive wat which simply receives sensations from outside,
  mind leaves its imprint on the way we apprehend the world

- the thing in itself and the thing for me

## before kant

- rationalism(reason) vs empiricism(experience)

- why not both?

- there is inside and outside world
- kant focuses inside world
  - outside world focused by hegel and schopen

- outside world is outside of human experience

- kant thought both sensing and reason come into play in our conception of the world


##

- david hume became skeptical of any metaphysical knowledge


- he makes the distinction between 3 philosophy
  - dogmatic - earlier metaphysicians (Descartes, S, L)
  - skeptical - david hume
  - critical

- kant's project is critical philosophy
  - examine the conditions to make metaphysics possible

- a critique of pure reason -> traditional metaphysical knowledge
  - pure -> apriora -> without any empirical input

- a critique of practical reason -> moral knowledge

- a critique of judgement -> aestetic judgement


- kant's greatest merit is to distinguish between apperance and thing in itself,
  by providing that the intellect always stands between us and things, which is
  why we cannot have cognition of things as they may be in themselves

- locke took the thing in itself and subtracted the part that the sense organs play in apperance
- kant subtracted the of brain functions too
- which agve infinitely greater meaning and a much more profound significance to
  the distinction between apperances and things in themselves

- to do so, he had to separate very clearly between our a priori and our a
  posteriori cognition


- kant's philosophy has a threefold relation to that of his predecessors:

1. it confirms and expands on locke
2. it corrects and makes of hume
3. it has a decidedly polemical and destructive relation to the philosophy of leibniz and wolff
