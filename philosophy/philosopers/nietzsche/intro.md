# nietzsche

- higher man => caotic

- herd morality -> confirm

- solitude -> self-affirming
  - why do I live?
  - why do i suffer?

- nihilism -> everything lacks meaning

- there is no truth

- the overman (the ideal)
  - not possible to maintain this perfection
  - back to being human

- human too far from the overwoman ideal -> self-hatred

- self-hatred -> great love for himself

- the affirmation of life
  - amor fati (love of fate) - wish to say yes to uglines
  - eternal recurrence -> test of saying yes-saying


## morality 

## education

- higher education now is common education, universal

- 3 tasks for which educators are needed

1. you have to learn to *see*
  - defer judgment
  - not to react immediately to a stimulus
  - strong will
2. you have to learn to *think*
3. you have to learn to *spean and write*
