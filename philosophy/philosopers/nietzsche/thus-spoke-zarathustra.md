# thus spoke zarathustra


- human beings who are nothing more than one big eye, or one big maw or one big
  belly or some other big thing, *inverse cripples* i call such types

- it was an inverse cripple who had too little of everything and too much of one thing

- if the truest virtue is the one that is not aware of itself, well, the vein
  man knows nothing of his modesty!
