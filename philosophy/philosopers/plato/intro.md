# plato

- students of socrates

- unlike socrates, plato investigated the nature of the universal truth
  - the manner of determining the nature of knowledge -> metaphysics

- unlike socrates (discoursing with anyone -> democratic), plato considered that
  this power of attaining universal knowledge was to be found only in a selected few. (aristocratic)

- dialectic method was not a discourse with any and everybody, it was a
  discourse with oneself, he believed in reflection

- emprical knowledge: practical and direct, drived from practical experiences
- rational knowledge: derived from reflection and medidation

- reality does not consist in appearances but in ideas
- material objects are the manifestation of the universal ideas
- reality is not matter, is idea
