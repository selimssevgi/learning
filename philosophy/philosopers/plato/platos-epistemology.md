# plato's epistemology

- scientific cosmological approach
- moral order approach

- same question: knowledge vs skepticism develops

- plato inherits that debate from socrates


- how can we know for sure? 
- how can we go beyond relative varrying opinions?

- can virtue be tought?

- to be thought, we need knowledge
- what is knowledge?


- opinion is based on experience
- experience is based on sensory, perceptions
- experience is relative to the condition and position of object

### what is dialectic?

- thinking smth through to a conclusion that is gonna be true of all times and places
- thinking beyond the relativies
- recollection (oh i started to remember)

- plato belives we born with innate knowledge, with enough probing, we can reach that awareness
- caved prisoner


- two realms of being:
  1. physical particules (opinion)  => rhetoric = sensory world
    - images/imagination = illusion
    - manmade objects, physical particular = perception
  2. universal truths, reality (knowledge) => dialectic = intellectable world
    - reasoning/references (deductive reasoning)
    - 1st principles (dialectic)




- plato talks about the love of the good, truth
- what is the physilogical dynamics involved in getting a person focused on 1st
  principles instead of fascinating physical particulers?

- in sympozium: whole dialogue: what is love(eros=desire)?
