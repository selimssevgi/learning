# philosopher's projects

- plato: concerned with relationship between what is eternal and immutable, on
  the one hand, and what **flows** on the other

- plato turned his back on the sensory world

### aristo

- what came first -- the chicken or the "idea" chicken?
- are we born with innate "ideas"?
- what is the difference between a plant, an animal, and a human?
- why does it rain?
- what does it take to live a good life?

- interest in natural processes
- while plato used his reason, aristo used his senses as well

- chicken idea was not smth separated from the chicken itself, together like body and soul

- nothing existed in consciousness that has not first been experienced by the senses

- senses -> consciousness -> ideas -> innate reason -> organizing/categorizing

- substance always contains the potentiality to realize a specific form
