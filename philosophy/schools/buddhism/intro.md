- buddhism is about:
  - compassionate living
  - ceasing suffering

### how to be buddhist

- what part of us wants to be a Buddhist?
  - branch or distance yourself from your past religion?
  - eastern philosophy that you might think is cool?

- buddhism is transcending our need wanting and attachment to being not only
  somebody but living as somebody being a Buddhist

- the core of Buddhism is focused on the liberation of self

- the ego is not the fundamental goal of Buddhism
