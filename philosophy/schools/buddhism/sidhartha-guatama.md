# Siddhartha Guatama

- born in Nepal, was in north-east India

- born to a noble hindu family

> going to be a great ruler, if he stays home or a great spiritual leader if he
> leaves the home -- his mother

- for the first half of his life, he stays home, given all possibilities, married, had a son

- he makes four trips at the age of 29; on each trip he sees something:
  - an old man
  - a sick man
  - a dead body
  - a happy but poor guy begging for money

- all bad things happens to people, and knowing all, still some people are happy

- he can't stay home, he needs answers: can we be happy when there is so much misery and suffering?
