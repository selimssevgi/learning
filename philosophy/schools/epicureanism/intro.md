# epicureanism

- we must concern ourselves with healing of our own lives

- healing: bring soul back from worries of life to simple joy of existing

- attention is toward plesure, the pleasure of existing

- distinguishing between desires:
  - natural and necessary
  - natural but not necessary
  - neither natural nor necessary


- joy of existing: the cries of the flesh are:
  - not to be hungry
  - not to be thirsty
  - not to be cold
