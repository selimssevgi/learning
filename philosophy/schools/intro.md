# philosphical shools

- 4 great philosphical schools

1. platonism
2. aristotelianism
3. epicureanism
4. stoicism

- each school represents a form of life defined by an ideal of wisdom
  - exercises of reason that will be for the soul (like athletes)
  - application of a medical cure

- they consist, above all, of self-control and meditation

- meditation
  - upon death
  - an attentive concentration on the present moment
