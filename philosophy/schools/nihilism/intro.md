# nihilism

- god is dead -> nihilism

- there is no objective meaning to our lives

- two responses to the problem of nihilism:

1. existentialism
  - we create our own meaning by the way we live our lives
2. absurdism
  - we shouldn't seek to create our own meaning but should stare into the face of absurd
