# intro to skepticism

- opinion is not knowledge

- phyrrhonism

- sextus empiricus

* two skeptical traditions

1. academic skepticism
  - sensory information dont actually enable you to know anything
  - knowledge (of the world) is impossible
2. pryyhonian skepticism
  - keep questions open
  - is knowledge possible?
  - who knows?



- dreaming argument
- evil genius (controlling your senses)
- brain in a vat


- for the skeptics:
  - apperances(sensations, feelings) and conventions(law, tradition) acceptable guides for living
  - judgments or interpretations of them were not
