# outlines of skepticism

- he is concerned not to advance doctrines of his own (for a skeptic has no
  doctrines to advance) but to stop the doctrines of the dogmatists

- if you are sceptical, you tend:
  - not to accept what others say
  - not to believe what you hear
  - not to trust what you read

- a sceptic is essentially someone who does not believe things

- if you undertake any inquiry, one of 3 things will result:
  - you will hit upon a solution
  - you will determine that it is impossible to hit upon a solution
  - you will continue the search (skeptic)

- the most fundamental kinds of philosophy are reasonably thought to be three:

1. dogmatic (they discovered the truth, aristotle, epicurus, stoics)
2. academic (asserted things cannot be apprehended, academics(plato))
3. skeptical (still investigating)



- in order for the dispute that has arisen about standards to be decided, we
  must posses an agreed standard through which we can judge it

- in order for us to possess an agreed standard, the dispute about standards
  must already have been decided

- the argument falls into the reciprocal mode and the discovery of a standard is blocked

- for we do not allow them to assume a standard by hypothesis

- since a proof needs a standard which has been proved
- and a standard needs a proof which has been judged
- they are thrown into the reciprocal mode


- standard we are investigating is thought to be threefold:

1. that by which (human being)
2. that through which (senses and intellect)
3. that in virtue of which
