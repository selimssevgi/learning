# spiritual exercise

### stoic

- in the view of all philospical schools, mankind's principal cause of:
  - suffering
  - disorder
  - unconsciousness
- were the passions:
  - unregulated desires
  - exaggerated fears

- the object of spiritual exercises is precisely to bring about this transformation


- stoics:
  - human vision of relatity (our values depend on our passions)
  - nature vision of relatity (replaces each event within the perspective of universal nature)


- thanks to philo of alexandria, stoico-platonic inspired philosphical therapeutics:
  - attention (concentration on the present moment)
  - meditations (on the rule of life: povery, suffering, death)
    - what you do in the morning
    - what i have done in the evening
    - discourse with inner voice
  - rememberance of good things
  - reading
  - listening
  - research
  - through investigation
  - self-mastery
  - accomplishment of duties
  - indifference to indifferent things
  - therapies of passions

### epicureism

- we must concern ourselves with healing of our own lives

- healing: bring soul back from worries of life to simple joy of existing



- exercises varies widely from one philosophical schol to another:
  - mobilization of energy and consent to desting of the Stoics
  - relaxation and detachment of epicureans
  - mental concentration and renunciantion of the sensible world among platonists
