# epictetus

- distinguished 3 acts or functions of the soul:

1. judgment (objective representation)
2. desire (indifference)
3. inclination or impulsion

- since each of these activities of the soul depends on us, we can discipline them

1. judges -> logic
2. desires -> physics/body (part of universive)
3. inclinations -> ethics (acting)

- the meaning of our existince resides in this contemplation: we have been
  placed on earth in order to comtemplate divine creation, and we must not die
  before we have witnessed its marvels and lived in harmony with nature


- epictetus, bases his doctrine on the traditional stoic distinction between :
  - things which depend on us (value-judgements, everything in our doing)
  - things which do not (body, wealth, etc not our own doing)


1. people are not troubled by things, but by their judgements about things


- discipline and virtues
  - desire -> temperance, absense of worries
  - inclinations -> justice
  - assent -> truth, absense of hurry


### assent

- human impressions have "propositional content", that is, our mind
  automatically frame them as statement, such as:
  - that is good thing to have
  - that is right thing to do

- they also involve an intermediate step:
  - the impression requires our "assent" before it generates impulse to act on it

### choice

1. rational animal can hold off acting on impressions until they scrutinized and assessed

2. if they are judged unreasonable (irrational or merely impractical), we can
   and should withhold our *assent* from them


- dont make the force of an impression when it first hits you know you off your
  feet, just say to it, "hold on a moment, let me see who you are and what you
  represent, let me put you to test"
