# the dichotomy of control

- the chief task in life is simply this:
  - to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself:
    - which are externals not under my control, and
    - which have to do with the choices I actually control
  - where then do i look for good and evil?
  - not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own
