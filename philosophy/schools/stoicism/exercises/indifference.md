# indifference

- we are to regard everything which does NOT depend on us as indifferent
- we must not make any *difference* between such things

- we must accept them all, willed as they are by universal nature

- universal reason perspective

- every event will seem to us beautiful and worthy of our affectionate assent

- to be indifferent to indifferent things means to make no difference between
  them, to love them equally, just as nature does

- universal nature "loves" to produce them
