# objective representation

- always make a definition or description of the object that occurs in your representation
- so as to be able to see it as it is in its essence, both as a whole and as divided into its constituent parts
- say to yourself its proper name and the names of those things out of which it is composed, and into which it will be dissolved


- it consist of refusing to add subjective value-judgments such as
  - this object is unpleasent
  - that one is good
  - this one is bad
  - that one is beautiful
  - this is ugly
- to the objective representation of things which do not depend us, thefore have no moral value
