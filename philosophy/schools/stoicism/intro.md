- goal of stoic exericesis is to go beyond the self, and think and act in unison with universal reason

- attention is orientied toward the purity of one's intentions

- philosophy as an exercise, not consist of teaching an abstract theory

* 4 features that constitute the universal stoic attitude:

1. stoic consciousness of 'the fact that no being is alone, but that we make up
   part of a whole, constituted by the totality of human beings as well as by the totality of the cosmos'

2. stoic 'feels absolutely serene, free, and invulnerable to the extent that he
   has become aware that there is no other evil but moral evil and that the only
   thing that counts is the purity of moral consciousness'

3. stoic 'believes in the absolute value of human person'

4. stoic exercises his concentration 'on the present instant, which consists, on
   the one hand, in living as if we were seeing the world for the first and for
   the last time, and, on the other hand, in being conscious that, in this lived
   presence of the instant, we have access to the totality of time and of the world'
