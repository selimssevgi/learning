# courage

- seneca would say that he actually pitied people who have never experienced mistfortune
  - "you have passed life without an opponent"
  - "no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you"

- the world wants to know what category to put you in, which is why it will
  occasionally send difficult situations your way

- think of these not as inconveniences or even tragedies but as opportunities, as questions to answers
