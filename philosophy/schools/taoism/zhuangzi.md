# zhuangzi

- the central theme of the zhuangzi may be summed up in a single word: freedom

- how is man to live in a world dominated by chaos, suffering, and absurdity?

- zhuangzi's answer to the question is: free yourself from the world

- "why did you come with all this crowd of people?"

- most of the philosophies of ancient china are addressed to the political or
  intellectual elite, zhuangzi's is addressed to the spiritual elite
