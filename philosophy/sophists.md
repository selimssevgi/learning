# greek sophist

- skepticism about the possibility of knowing the truth about reality, about nature?

- practical instead of theoritical matters

- ethics/moral just conventions social contracts

- instead of pursuing the truth, they are after winning an argument


- nothing exists
- if anythin exists, i cant know what that is
- even if i could know, it is not talkable


- socrates is not like other sophists going after success

- socrates cares about norturing the human soul
