# netwon's laws

1. in the absence of any forces an object, if it had certain velocity would
   continue along a straight line forever
   - does not hold in all reference frames(accelerated reference frame)
   - it only works in inertial reference frame


2. F = mass x acceleration
  - in speed of light, this law does not hold
  - theory of special relativity


3. if one object exerts a force on another, the other exerts the same force in
   opposite direction on the one
  - action = -reaction
  - always hold, with move or acceleration
