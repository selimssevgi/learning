# ac vs dc electricity

- alternative current
- direct current


- dc is: (like a river)
  - provided by: battery, capacitor, car battery
  - used by: most electronic diveces use a dc power, LEDs,
  - very simple/easy to make
  - easy to use
  - pretty expensive to change the voltage of a dc signal
  - difficult to create a good ac signal from dc power

- ac is: (like a wave)
  - provided by: generator
  - used by: motors, incasdescent lights
  - generated easily mechanically
  - much easier to increase/decrease voltage with simple and low-cost transformers
  - easier to transport over long distances
  - easy to change to dc in efficient process
  - not so portable
