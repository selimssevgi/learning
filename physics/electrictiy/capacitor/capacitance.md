# capacitance

- Q / V = farad

- capacitance value depends on Radius

- bigger the size of the object, bigger their capacitance

- the more capacitance, the more charge the object has

- capability of holding charge for a given electric potential

- putting two spheres one positively, one negatively charged
- the work needed to bring a new charge to positively charged one is less now
  - cus of the presence of other negatively charged one
  - so then positively charge one will have less V
  - less V mean more capacitance
  - now instead of capacitance of positively charge object, we say capacitance
    of positively charged object in the presence of negatively charged object


- two conductor, same charge, with different polarities
- capacitance = charge / potential diff

- capacitance = A x epsilon / distance

- the smaller the distance between two planes, the bigger the capacitance

- we can think of a capacitor as a device that can store electric energy
