# led (1907 by H.J.Round)

- electroluminescence is when a metarial emits a light when an electric currnet run throught it

- short leg is negative terminal
- long leg is positive terminal

- current flows from long leg to short leg


### forward voltage

- since leds are diodes, the voltage and current relationship is not linear

- you increase the voltage, increase the voltage, and no current flow
  - then you hit a certain point(forward voltage)
  - then led starts to conduct, and current increases afterwards

- different colors have different forward voltages
  - different semiconductor material
