# electric charge

- you set down an object, and it has same number of protons and electrons
  - it is neutral

### charging by friction

- rub pwc pipe over cat's fur
  - fur will give up on its electrons
  - pwc pipe will get the electrons

### charging by contact

- using charged pwc pipe to touch the top of electroscope

### charging by induction

1. bring charged object nearby
  - polarizes the electroscope

2. provide a conducting path to ground (ground one side of electrscope)
  - electrons either leave or enter electroscope

3. remove ground

4. remove charged object

- electrscope will be opposite charge of original object
