# electric field

- an electric field is a measurable effect generated by any charged object

- electric field = electric force / charge(so small almost no electric field)
- electric field = newtons / columns = N / C
- electric field = constant x q / r^2

- can an electric field exist in a conductor, where electrons can move around
  freely in the material?


## conductors in static equilibrium

- all charge resides on outside

- in a conductor, if electrons see electric fields inside, they start to move
  until they experience no longer a force,thereby they kill the electric field inside them

- so the charge in a conductor always rearranges itself so that the electric field becomes zero

- when net force is 0, electric field is 0

- it is not possible to get an electric field inside a hollow conductor

- the electric force arises from a electric field
