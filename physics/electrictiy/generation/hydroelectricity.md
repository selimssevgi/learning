# hydroelectricity

- using the kinetic energy of flowing water

- water flows down, and rotates the blades of a water turbine

- kinetic energy of flowing water -> rotational kinetic energy -> electrical energy

## advantages

- source of energy(water) is free and renewable

- pollution free process

- cost of electricity generation is low compared to other ways

## disadvantages

- environmental

- not all areas are suitable for it
