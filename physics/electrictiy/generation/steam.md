# steam

- in most cases, the type of energy being converted to electricity is heat

- vast majority of methods we use to generate power are essentially just different ways to getting water really hot

- many thermal power plants use fossil fuels like coal or natural gas in a
  furnace to generate steam

- some plants use the fission of radioactive elements in a nuclear reactor as a
  source of heat

- some parts of the world can use geothermal energy, heat from inside the
  earth's crust

- arrays of mirrors to concentrate sunlight and create enough heat to run a boiler

- once the steam is created, it passes through a turbine which converts the
  thermal energy into rotational energy
