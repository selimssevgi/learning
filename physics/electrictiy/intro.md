# electricity

- the movements of electrons is what forms an electric current

- when in a ground state or unchanged, it is called an atom 
- when charged, negatively or positively, they are called a negative or positive ion

- the number of electrons on the outermost shell determines the reactivity of the atom
  - this shell is called valence shell
  - when outer shell is full, atom generally stable, least reactive

- nature always seeks a neutral charge equilibrium, a net charge of zero

- materials with high electron mobility are called *conductors*
  - copper

- materials with low electron mobility are called *insulators*
  - plastic


- electrons are not spent, they do not cease existing
- they are mere carriers of charge and can only be useful on their way to their destionation
