# static electricity

- known 2000 years ago

- it does not move

- here instead of metals, we deal with insulators

- if two different nonmetal insulators rub against each other, then they both
  may become charged by friction

- electrons may be removed from the surface of one, and deposited on the surface
  of the other, once there the electrons cannot move, they are static
