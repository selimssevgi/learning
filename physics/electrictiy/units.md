# units

## V: voltage - force - potantial - pressure

## I: amper - current - amount

## watts

- unit of power, James Watt

- 1 watt = 1 joule per second

- watts = voltage x amps

- 10 volts x 10 amps = 100 watts
- 50 volts x  2 amps = 100 watts

- we can climb stair by walking(slow) or by running(fast)
  - we will be doing same amount of work

- power = work / time

- 1 horsepower ~= 746 watts

### power consumption

- power demand of an item: how much energy per second

- calculate kWh consumption of 60W for 10 hours:
  - 60W / 1000 = 0.06kW
  - 0.06kW x 10h = 0.6kWh

- calculate cost of 60W for 10 hours:
  - cost = kWh used x tariff per kWh

## joule - energy - ability to do work

- an amount of energy, transferred to do some work

- energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of 1 Amp, passes through a
  resistance of 1 Ohm in 1 second

- energy = power x time

## work

- work(joules) = force(newton) x distance(meter) x cos(angle)

- anything that can apply a force over a given distance is said to contain energy

- measured in joules

- work is just a change in energy

## force
