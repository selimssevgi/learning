# electromagnetism

* four fundamental forces

1. gravitational
2. electromagnetic
3. weak nuclear
4. strong nuclear


- electromagnetism is a branch of physics that studies the interactions between electric and magnetic fields

- all matter has an electric charge: positive, negative, zero

- these electric forces bring and hold atoms together

- when atoms gain a positive or negative charge through transfer of electrons, a
  measurable electric field will form

- interacting electric and magnetic fields can continuously produce and sustain one another
- this generates an electromagnetic field that transmits waves of
  electromagnetic energy, or radiation into space

- the intensity of this radiation is determined by its frequency
- these frequencies make up what's known as the electomagnetic spectrum

- unlike low-frequency waves these waves can pass through the human body making
  them useful for medical applications

- electromagnetism is also the engine that drives the planet as a whole

- thousands of miles below the earth's surface, a layer of liquid metals churn
  and flow, this generates electric currents then produce magnetic fields that
  all together encompass the entire planet

- geodynamo, causes earth's poles to attain positive and negative charges
- turning the planet into a giant electromagnet

- it also creates a protective layer around the planet that shields us from the
  most harmful radiation in space
