# light

- is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported

- a photon, an elementary particle without a real size

- a photon, cannot be split, only created or destroyed

- light has a wave-particle duality

- light mean visible light

- light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like a both wave and a particle

- light is a wave of electric and magnetic fields

- visible light is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum

- electromagnetic specture: energy in form of electromagnetic radiation

- electromagnetic radiation consist of an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies

- gamma rays have the smallest wave lengths because they are the highest energy photons

- what is the fastest way to travel through space in the universe?


- the only thing that makes a kind of light different from another is its wavelength
