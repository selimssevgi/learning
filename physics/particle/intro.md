# into to particle

- matter is made of fundamental particles

- particles interact with each other according to a theory called the *Standard Model*

- world of indivisible, infinitely small particles

- covers the forces that govern how particles move, interact and bind together
  to give shape to the world around us

- chemical compound -> molecule -> element -> atom -> nucleus -> 


- these heavy particles are only produced, for very brief moments in high energy
  collisions and are not seen in everyday life

- particles decay very quickly into the lighter particles

- such decays involve the exchange of force-carrying particles:
  - z and w
  - unlike photon, they have mass
  - they carry the weak force, the final force of the standard model
