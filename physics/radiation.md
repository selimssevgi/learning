# radiation

1. electromagnetic radition - pure energy
2. nuclear radiation
  - all nuclear radiation is ionizing

- radiation is the release of energy in the form of moving waves or streams of particles

- an atom could have too many or too few neutrons
  - carbon-12, carbon-13, carbon-14

- when this happens, it becomes unstable, or radioactive

- an unstable atom is called a radioisotope

- radioactive atoms want to become stable again, so they release energy until
  they get back to a balanced state

- releasing this energy is known as radiactive decay

- there are 3 types of radioactive decays:

1. alpha - heavy particle, travel small distances
2. beta - lighter particle, travel further
3. gamma- is a wave, it travels the farthest of all 


- the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms of a radioisotope to decay is called *half-life*
- half-life can range from a fraction of a second to billions of years
