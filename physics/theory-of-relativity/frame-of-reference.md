# frame of reference

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJMYoj4hHqU

- all frames of reference are eqaully valid

- there is no way to determine if you are moving or rest, only the *relative*
  motion between objects is physically meaningful


- principle of relativity

## inertial vs non-inertial frame of reference (galileo)

- velocity measurements always depend on *inertial reference frame* the observer adopts

- inertial frame of reference is one in which the law of inertia holds:
  - a body at rest or moving with a constant velocity will continue to remain at
    rest or keep moving with that constant velocity unless an external force is applied to it

- earth's frame is inertial frame of reference

- accelerating frame of reference is a non-inertial frame of reference
  - thrown ball in an accelerating train will not fall in same horizontal

- when we see an acceleration of the ball sideways, we think there is a force cauing it
- in reality there is no force other than gravitational force
- fictitious forces arise in accelerated frames of reference

- rotating frame of reference is not an inertial frame


* what happens when traveling at or near the speed of light?
