# equivalence principle

- F = ma (inertial mass)
- F = mg (gravitional mass)

* if smth is in *free fall*, the net force on it is gravity, the acceleration of
  free falling object is a = g


- if you are in an elevator, and suddenly cable breaks:
  - accelerating with g
  - not feeling gravity
  - no difference from being outer space
  - ZERO-G



- Special relativity is for inertial reference frame

- an accelerated reference frame can be made that mimics the presence of gravitional field

- you are in an elevator in outer space, and elevator is pushed/accelerated(a=g)
  - you being in the elevator, you will feel this as gravity

- in this case, there is no way to differentiate the elevator in space and elevator on earth

- give a source of light to the people in these two elevator
- the light will have parabola and bend


* gravity affect light
* light has no mass
* gravity field curva space and time
