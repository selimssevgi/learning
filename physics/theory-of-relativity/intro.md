# theory of relativity

- based on 2 principles:

1. if you have just two objects, and nothing else, then it is not possible to
   tell which object is moving, and which object is standing still


- for something from spaceship, the planet is moving
- for something from planet, the spaceship is moving
- for something from sun, the spaceship and the planet is moving
- for something from universe, the all three are moving

- in general, any observer can believe that they are standing still, and that
  the rest of the universive is moving around them

- and every observer is equally correct


2. the speed of light is the same for all observers

- the closer that a spaceship appraoches speed of light, the slower the time inside the ship will flow

- if the speed of the spaceship was equal to the speed of light, then time
  inside the ship would stop all together








- einstein's work was heavily influenced by two most iconic physicists:
  - laws of motion discovered by his idol isaac newton
  - laws of electromagnetism laid down by James Clerk Maxwell

- faster you move through space, the slower you move through time

* *newton*'s laws insisted that velocities are never absolute but always negative
- so that their magnitudes must be appended by "with respect to"
  - train travel 40 km/h with respect to someone at rest
  - train travel 20 km/h with respect to a train traveling at 20 km/h
  - train travel 60 km/h with respect to a train traveling in the opposite direction at 20 km/h

- this is true for the velocities of earth, sun and entire milky way


* *maxwell* found that speed of an electromagnetic wave such as ligh is fixed at
  an exorbitant 299,792,458 m/s regardless of who observes it


- maxwell's notion seems incompatible with newton's notion of relative
  velocities, if newton's laws are truly universal. Why should the speed of
  light be an exception?


- time dilation

- newton believed the time moved unflinchingly in a single direction forward
- einstein had just realized the time stretches and contracts varying with velocity
