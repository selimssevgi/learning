# special relativity

- is comprised of two postulates

- requires that we completely restructure our understanding of space and time

- inertial reference frames have *zero acceleration*
  - velocity is constant
  - for example earth

## postulate 1

* the laws of physics are the same in every inertial reference frame

## postulate 2

* the speed of light is the same in every inertial reference frame

* the speed of light is a fundamental law

- it is the universal speed limit


## conclusion 1

- time flows at different rates for different observers
