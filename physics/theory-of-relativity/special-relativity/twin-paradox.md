# twin paradox

- one of them goes on a journay in space

- the other stays on earth

- the traveling twin measures 10 years each way

- after return, the twins are no longer the same age

- if earth is the inertial reference frame, then the ship does all the
  traveling, so the traveler should be aged less

- if ship is the inertial reference frame, then the universe does all the
  traveling, so the twin on earth should be aged less

- the ship did all of the accelerating so it is not a non-inertial reference
  frame, where relativity does not apply

- we must treat the earth as inertial reference frame
