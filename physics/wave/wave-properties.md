# wave properties

1. frequency
2. period
3. wavelength
4. amplitude

## frequency

- the number of complete waves passing a fixed point in a given amount of time

- symbol is f

- is measured in hertz(Hz)
  - how many complete cycles per second

## period

- the time for one complete cycle

- when something happens repeatedly: periodic

- the period of the earth to orbit the sun is 365 days
- the period of a day is 24 hours

## wavelength

- the distance between two peaks or two troughs

- lambda, measured in meters

## amplitude
