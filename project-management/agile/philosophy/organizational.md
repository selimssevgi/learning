# organizational impact of agile

#### conway's laws

- an organization that design a system will produce a design whose structure is
  a copy of the organization's communication structure




- teams are loosely coupled, tightly aligned

- each team has its own mission aligned with business (like a 'mini startup')

- teams have end-it-end responsibility for what they build

- the long-term mission is usually around a single business domain

### autonomy is important

- it is motivating, motivated people build better stuff

- it is fast, decisions happen locally in the team

- it minimizes handoffs and waiting, so teams dont get bogged down

### the agile dilemma

- development: I want change
- WALL OF CONFUSION
- operations: I want stability

### the entire org must be agile
