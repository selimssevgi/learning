# attachment theory

- caregiver feeds the child and provides nourishment, the child becomes attached

- attachment is an emotional bond with another person

- nurturance and responsiveness were the primary determinants of attachment

- the central theme of attachment theory is that:
  - primary caregivers who are available and responsive to an infant's needs to allow child to develop a sense of security
  - the infant knows that the caregiver is dependable, which creates a secure base for child to then explore the world

## 3 major styles of attachment

1. secure attachment
2. ambivalent-insecure attachment (clingy, needy, require constant validation and reassurance)
3. avoidant-insecure attachment (dismissive attitude, difficulty reaching out)

3. disorganized-insecure attachment (has no real coping strategies and is unable to deal with the world)
