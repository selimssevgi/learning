# B.F Skinner

- behaviorism has 3 main claims: 

1. emphasis on learning
  - you can be anything

2. anti-mentalism
  - doing real science (not like freud)
  - unscientific: desires, wishes, goals, beliefs, emotions
  - scientific: observables, stimulus, response, environment

3. no differences across species


### 3 learning principles

1. habituation
  - a decline in the tendency to respond to familiar stimuli due to repeated exposure
  - an adaptive mechenism that keep us focusing on new objects and events

2. classical conditioning
  - learning of an association between one stimulus and another stimulus
