# conscious

- the awareness that you are having your own thoughts makes up consciousness


## psychology of disorders of consciousness

* anosognosia (losing ability to move left arm)
  - move your right arm
  - person says here you go (and moves it)
  - move your left arm
  - person says here you go (but arm does not move)
  - when asked why
  - they gave excuses instead of saying that they can't


* anton-babinski syndrome (cortically blind)
  - they cannot see anything
  - they deny being blind
  - explain their accuracy with excuse



- there is a disconnect between what they experience and their conscious awareness of it
