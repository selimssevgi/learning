# developmental psychology

- morality
  - we start as animal, brutal, later socialized
  - we start as good, later corrupted

- continuity (child -> adult)

- cognitive development (knowledge)
  - empiricism: how much we know when born (empty?)
  - nativism: we are born with powerful structures
  - constructivism: 


## jean piaget

- founder of developmental psychology


- assimilation: fitting it into existing one
- accomodation: changing existing ones or creating new ones

## stages

1. stage 1: sensorimotor - age 0-2
  - information gained through senses and motor actions
  - child perceives and manipulates but does not reason
  - *object permanence* : in sensation, in here and now, amused by peekaboo

2. stage 2: preoperational - age 2-7
  - emergence of symbolic thought
  - reasoning develops but not high level
  - egocentrism - cannot see the world though eyes of others
  - lack of concept of conservation (spreading things around increase their number?)

3. stage 3: concrete operational - age 7-12
  - understanding mental operations, leading incrasingly logical thought
  - less egocentrict
  - inability to reason abstractly or hypothetically

4. stage 4: formal operational - age 12-adult
  - abstract and scientific reasoning
