# the emotional brain

## what are emotions for?

- our emotions, they say, guide us in facing predicaments and tasks too important to leave to intellect alone
  - danger, painful loss, persisting toward a goal despite frustrations, bonding
    with a mate, building a family


- despite the social constraints, passions overwhelm reason time and again


- emotion in latin means "move away", suggesting that a tendency to act is
  implicit in every emotion
