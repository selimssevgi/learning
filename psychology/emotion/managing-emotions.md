- if you keep stretching a rubber band, it becomes frayed and increasingly prone to breaking

- actively work to put yourself in a more relaxed state

- LEARN HOW TO RELAX!!!

- LEARN SELF-CONTROL!!!

- practive self-reflexiveness - to think about what you are doing while you are doing it

- observe others' emotions

- after activating event

## asses and label

- identify feelings
  - physical sensations
  - nonverbal
    - body movement
    - vocal quality
  - words being used

- consider stimulus
  - thoughts? emotional fallacies?
  - caught from someone else?

- label
  - choose the right words
  - consider intensity
  - mixed emotions? primary to second emotion?
  - facilitative(easy)? debilitative(weak)?

- journaling? daily, weekly, monthly?

## decision

- determine if you want to express emotions

- consider necessity
- time/place
- consider consequences
- determine if you need to change your thinking/behavior?


- yes, now (manage yourself - expression)
- yes, but not now (identify time/place)
- no (self-care)

## expression

- choose language

- instead of sharing your emotions, you could share your physical reactions
  - I am so worried I cannot sleep, I cannot eat...

- if your emotions are intense, dont downplay them

- try not to make the emotion broadsweeping
  - relate the emotion to a specific circumstance, not the whole relationship

- accept responsibility for emotion
  - start with "I" not with "you"

- manage your nonverbal behavior

- be prepared for consequences
