# the language of emotions

- astonishing secret that lives inside the emoitonal reals:
  - if you trust and attend to your emotions, they will take care of you.
  - if you dont, your life will be pretty miserable, and you will leave a mess for others to clean up

## creating a conscious life

- we are intellectually brilliant, physically resourceful, spritiually
  imaginative, but emotionally underdeveloped

- verbal skills and pure rationality may be what make us so smart, but it is our
  emotions and our empathy that make us brilliant, decisive, and compassionate human beings

- protection of anger, the intuition of fear, the rejuvenation of sadness, the ingenuity of depression

## my empathic journey

- emotions carry distinct and diverse messages that can be distinguished with absolute certainty

- dissociated people live in the future, in the past, and in fantasy

- everyone was losing this battle with emotions. i began to understand that
  emotions were unavoidable, so i tried to live with them

## troubled waters

- without access to our emotional selves, we grow in this culture like trees in
  the wrong soil, becoming tall but not strong, and old but not mature

- if we dont have internal emotional skills, we can feel trapped in our
  emotional state, unable to moderate or even understand our moods unless
  someone or something outside of us is available

- repression is the only internal emotional management skill most of us have

- repsessing -> unconscious has two choices:
  - to increase the intensity of the emotion
  - present it to us one more time

- emotions are always true
- they always thell the truth about how we are actually feeling
- but they may not always be right or appropriate in each situation

- we must find the middle path between repression and improper expression

- there is a way to work with emotions in a respectful and honorable way:
  *channeling the emotions*

### it takes a village

- empathy is one of the multiple kinds of intelligence we have

- emotional intelligence
- logical intelligence
- linguastic intelligence
- musical intelligence
- bodily-kinesthetic intelligence (dancers, athletes)
- spatial intelligence (builders, geometry, visual artists)


- four-element or quaternity model:
  - earth -> physical world and your body
  - air   -> your mental and intellectual realm
  - water -> your emotional and artistic realm
  - fire  -> your visionary or spiritual realm


- allowing your emotions to flow naturally is the foundation of the ability to
  channel emotions properly and skillfully

- emotions identify imbalance and then move from inbalance to understanding to resolution

- it is important to stop for a moment and look at the unnecessary struggle that
  has been manufactured between our airy logical intelligences and our watery emotional intelligences

- we certainly can't honor and channel our emotions skillfully until we know:
  - how to approach our intellect empathically
  - how to approach our emotions intelligently

- healthy, mature judgment isn't:
  - bad-tempered name-calling
  - simple-minded categorization of the world


- thoughts and emotions are partners. they are not enemies

- our emotions convey messages between our unconscious and conscuous minds

- in an unbalanced psyche, our logical intelligence might overthink and eventually crush our vision
- or our dishonored emotions might overreact and scare us away from the vision


- visionary life vs day-to-day life
- intellectual life vs emotional life
- spirit vs body

- we dont know how to incorporate:
  - meditation, day, or contemplation into
  - everyday world of driving, working and paying the rent

- split between spirit and body
- split between mind and emotion

- when we are split apart, there is no flowing movement between our s/b or m/e
- there is no understanding of the importance of each of our intelligences

- every element and intelligence is alternately glorified and then ignored
- the body isn't allowed to walk the truth of the other elements
- the spirit is not allowed to bring its visions to each part of the psyche
- the mind isnot allowed to translate for other sturggling elements
- the emotions arent allowed to convey energy and information between the warring factions

- when the body and spirit are at odds, and the portaging abilities of emotions
  are ignored by both, the intellect will often go into high gear

- when there is no communication between the elements, and the intellect is
  forced to take a forward position in our psyches

- nothing will be accomplished, because our bodies won't be allowed to bring our
  thoughts into the world in visceral ways

- the psyche doesnot function properly when the intellect is in charge; instead
, it spins and whirls into endless planning, scheming, "what-if-ing", and obsessing

- an intellect working alone will always have poor judgment, because it wont
  have access to the whole picture

## reviving your essential nature

- you can work from a position of strentg
- you can then add intuition and vision, emotional flow, artistic and linguistic
  skills, intellectual awareness, or physical competence into your mix and move
  forward into wholeness


- conscious practices in the realm of each element bring that element back into balance in your whole self


### balancing earth

- you should move into conscious
  - physical activity
  - nutrition
  - rest

- restoring balance to your earth element means bringing your physical life into consciousness
  - not only by allowing your body to build, feel, explore, and create
  - but by taking excellent and respectful care of yourself

- any sort of movement that brings you into contact with your body and the world
  around you helps bring your earthy intelligences into balance

### balancing water

- anything that releases feelings through your body or your mind will help bring
  your water element back into balance

- dance and expressive movement
- music and art of all kinds
- writing (especially poetry)
- any nature pursuit is deeply healing for your emotive self





- when you live in an unbalanced quaternity, you will consistently forget to act or think or feel or dream

- the body is wise, the mind is stable, the emotions are healing, or fiery vision can free you


- unbalanced systems require lots of scapegoats, fans, flunkies, and cronies in order to keep themselves going
- they seem to have magnetic force around them that will drag you in before you even know it

- staying engaged with unbalanced people or systems can delay your own movement into wholeness 

- here are some clear signs of imbalance:
  - the presence of segregation (of people, elements, of intelligences)
  - the inability to tolerate mystery (and the need to explain things from one-sided perspectives)
  - the repudiation of whole elements or intelligences
  - absense of humor


### examples of fully resourced personalities

- groups of people who create a fifth-element entity at the center of their relationships

- the beatles
  - ringo starr held the earth element, the grounded beat and foundation
  - george harrison, held the air element, or the intellectual aspect
  - john lennon, held the water element, or the emotive and somtimes explosive aspect
  - paun mccartney, hold the fiery position as the visionary or leader of the group


- star trek
  - mr.scott, held the earth element, mechanical
  - spock, held air element and the intellectual expertise
  - dr.mccoy, hold the water element and the emotional awareness
  - captain kirk, held the fiery, visionary leadership role

### restoration and distraction: understanding the difference

- watch yourself and make sure that you are not relying on tasks to the exclusion of everything else


- make sure that you work with your emotions as well as you work with artistic media

- you work planning and logic in your daily life, rather than spending long
  hours reading, surfing online, playing games when life scatters you

- you work intuitive vision into your everyday life, rather than sequestering
  yourself with an isolating meditative practice

- you work the physical world and your body's needs into your daily
  deliverations, rather than relying on exercise or movement as after-the-fact stress-relieving tool


- if your practices isolate or distract you from the world or your own life,
  your central self won't be fully resourced


- allow yourself to feel whatever you're feeling, and your psyche will be able to flow once again

- when your psyche is unbalanced, you often create drama simply because you dont
  have access to your whole self

- if you choose to enter the deep water of your strong emotions as whole person,
  you will be able to swim and survive

### fighting the flow (warning: flow always wins)

- we get knocked over by physical pains and symptoms, when simply listening to
  our bodies could help us calm them

- we are tormented by obsssive and compulsive thoughts, when simply inviting our
  minds into a dialogue with their brother-and-syster elements could ease them

- we become powerless marionettes in response to our raging and distrusted
  emotions, when simply listening to their messages could help us heal

- distractions and addictions

- living without the resourced village inside us is jarring and perilous, which
  is why so many of us turn to addictions and distractions just to het through the day

## avoidance, addiction, and awakening

- some forms of dissoaciative practice:
  - avoidance of the trouble
  - distraction from the trouble
  - addiction to a substance that separates us from the trouble

- moving toward balance means moving away from distractions, addictions, and avoidance behaviors

- moving away from distractions can be quite difficult
- which is why going cold turkey on any distracting practice or substance is not recommended

- what happens right before we start with our distraction?
- what triggers our movement toward distractions and avoidance behaviors?

- in every case, right before we distract ourselves, there is always an emotion trying to come into consciousness
- not a thought, not a vision, not a physical sensation, but an emotion

- if we could move consciously into those emotions rather than into
  distractions, we would learn brilliant things about ourselves and our situations

- addictions, distractions, bad habits, repetitive behaviors, compulsions, and
  dissociative practices all help us function in spite of chaos

### bringing empathy to our addictions and distraction

- there is no way any of us can say no to distractions and addictions until we
  fully understand why we say yes

### when suffering ceases to be suffering

- honoring emotions: from inbalance to understanding to resolution

- staying with imbalance until we understand it (without distracting ourselves)
  is a vital part of moving to resolution

- "suffering ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it"

### the buddha and the bunny

- "suffering is discomfort multiplied by resistance"

- if I resist the original discomfort, that discomfort increases in intensity
  until I am in full-blown suffering



- our lust for distraction does not spring from the fountains of human
  knowledge; it comes directly from the heart of unhealed trauma

- how did a people as bright and verbal as ourselves miss the fact that
  unrelieved trauma (especially in childhood) impacts our society at every level?

## unintential shamans

- if you have got unhealed trauma is to check in and see if you can deal with
  and approach all of your emotions without dissociating, distracting yourself,
  or avoiding them

- in many cases of trauma, a person's sense of psychological boundaries is
  weakened, and his or her ability to connect to the world and other people is
  often disrupted

- traumatic and dissociative behaviors are almost always contagious

- emotional and psychological states can be very contagious

- we have ppor boundaries around our psyches and poor focus

### three responses to trauma

- two basic ways that people response to their dissociating traumas:
  - either they learn to traumatize themselves
  - or they learn to traumatize others

- by traumatizing themselves:
  - create feelings of powerlessness, dread, hopelessness
  - behavioral or sleep disorders
  - hyper or hypeactivity
  - depressions, learning disabilities, dissociative episodes, chronic pain
  - leads to addictions or compulsions, codependencies, neuroses, abusive relationships
  - live lives of desperation, lves that wont work properly no matter what they do


- traumatizers of others
  - to express traumatizing behaviors upon others as a way to relieve the disturbing effects of the trauma
  - powerlessness, dread, hopelessness
  - dont clamp down on their pain or contain it
  - they visit it upon others in an attempt to understand
  - their response to become abousers of themselves
  - to regain the power they lost in their original wounding

- cruelty is a learned behavior that springs directly from unhealed trauma


- there is a third response, just as there is with the emotions
- this third response to trauma ti to channel it from within an awakened psyche,
  to enter it consciously, to dive into the emotions, thoughts, the visions, and the sensations

### sociological aspects of trauma

- the issue is niether in the danger nor in the dissociation, but in the fact
  that we dont have the resillience to bring ourselves back to center once the
  danger has passed


- chicken egg
  - did we become unable to resolve trauma because we dont have a fully resourced village inside us?
  - did we lose access to the village inside us cus we dont understand how to reintegrate ourselves after trauma?


### the end will be beautiful

## the role of emotions in the resolution of trauma



## building your raft

1. getting grounded (sadness and fear)
2. defining your boundary (anger and shame)
3. burning contract
4. conscious complaining
5. rejuvenating yourself

### getting grounded

- the call to *be here now*

- fully aware and focused in the present moment, niether dissociated nor distracted

- if we can center our attention in our bodies, we will be here now

- bringing your focus into your body 

- grounding calms and regulates the flows within your psyche so that you can
  moderate and direct your thoughts, your bodily sensations, your visionary
  awareness, and of couse, your emotions

- grounding restores healthy flow to your body, and healthy bodies need to move

- this process is not about perfection; it is about wholeness, which means it encompasses:
  - peace and turmoil
  - grace and clumsiness
  - competence and incompetence
  - whole range of life experiences

### defining your boundaries

- personal space, aura

- anger helps you observe and respond to boundary violations coming from the exterior world
- shame helps you observe and avoid boundary violations that may come from your interior world

### concuous complaining

- when your emoitons are welcomed and honored, they move easily and quickly

- a distruption in the healthy flow of your emotions creates a dam that
  destabilizes your entire psyche

- your emoitons will get trapped behind that dam, but if the clog persist, the
  rest of your elements will be disrupted by all the trouble
    - repetitive thoughts that never go anywhere
    - body reacts to lack of flow with fatugue and distress
    - dissaciate and run toward your addictions

- complaining to an object, see problems, make them concious and move on


### rejuvenating yourself










- your goal is not perfection but wholeness
  - brilliant and stupid
  - solemn and rediculous
  - brave and cowarly
  - beautiful and ugly
  - hardworking and lazy


- when you have empathic skills, your emotions will become your allies instead
  of the beig bullies they can be in badly moderated system


## wading into the water

- the primary rule of emotional flow is this: all emotions are true

- this does not mean that all emotions are right or that you should take their word for everything

- emotions dont cause trouble by themselves, they simply bring energy and information forward

- not wading in is what causes emotional torment

- while dealing emotions(water), intelligence(air) just give a chance to breath,
  then you will have to dive back


## anger

- protection and restoration

- includes rage, fury, and the healing of trauma

- gifts: honor, conviction, proper boundaries, protection of yourself and others, healthy detachment

- internal questions:
  - what must be protected?
  - what must be restored?

- fury and rage step forward to tell you that people can only abuse you twice if you:
  - dont communicate your discomfort
  - dont leave when your communication is ignored


## apathy and boredom

- gifts: detachment, boundary-setting, separation, taking a time out

- internal questions:
  - what is being avoided?
  - what must be made conscious?

- signs of obstruction:
  - monotonous indifference
  - impassivity
  - distractibility that halts creative action

- this "masking" state of apathy(or boredom) arises when you are unable or
  unwilling to deal with your true anger

- apathy seqelches emotions by affecting an "I dont care, I can't be bothered; whatever" attitude

- apathy seeks distractions such as tv, fun food, new loves, travel, money, shopping and easy way out

- apathy is a dissociated state, usually related to being stuck in the wrong environment for your needs

- it masks emotions, though, apathy is powerless
- it longs for change, but it doesnt have the emotional agility to make conscious change happen

- boredom is a sign of becoming a product or a victim of your environment,
  instead of an active and aware participant

- apathy helps us belive that another car, the right lover, a different job, or
  the perfect lice of pie will cure us


- if your apathy wants a perfect lover, work on making yourself a valuable love
  partner instead of passively waiting for some super person to appear

- if your apath wants a better house, a better car, a better body, or a better
  wardobe, put your best critical energy into your current house, car,xxx, and
  make those things better right now
