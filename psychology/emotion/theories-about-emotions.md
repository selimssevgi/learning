- theories about how emotions happen:

- commonsense
- james-lange
- appraisal/label
- rational emotive

## commonsense

- emotions just happen
- this approach implies that you have no choice in the matter

```shell
stimulus -> emotional reaction -> physiological reaction
meet someone -> feel nervous and uncertain ->  blushing, increased heart rate
```

## james-lange (william james & carl lange)

- physiological first
- reverses the last two steps

```shell
stimulus -> physiological reaction -> emotional reaction
meet someone ->  blushing, increased heart rate -> feel nervous and uncertain
```

- stimulus may cause a physiological response, because if there is no physical
  reaction, then there will not be any emotion

## appraisal/label

- we appraise and label, then feel
- depending on how you label the response, you experience different emotion

- this approach allows us to have more control over our emotions because what we think is instrumental in what we feel
- if we change our thoughts, we can manage our emotions

```shell
stimulus -> physiological reaction -> label response -> experience emotion
meet someone ->  blushing, increased heart rate -> nervous -> feel nervous and uncertain
meet someone ->  blushing, increased heart rate -> excitement -> feel excitement
```

## rational emotive theory (albert ellis, 1955)

- it is very similar to the appraisal/label approach

- instead of saying that an event causes your emotions, how you think about
  those events is what causes your emotions

- your thoughs (beliefs) about events is the cause of your behavior

- your thinking causes your emotions


```shell
activatig event(stimulus) -> thoughts about event -> experience emotion -> physiological response
```

- a friend is late to the appointment (activating event)
- brain goes into action with thoughts, and there are a variety of thoughts to choose (self-talk)
  - an accident? (worry)
  - maybe she got that job? (hope)
  - does not think my time is important? (frustration)
  - this is how she always is? (acceptance)
- depends on which one you pick, the emotion will be different
