# anger

- anger is no way of telling other people that you are right and others are wrong

- anger is not the display of superioty

- anger is the loud cry of an unsettling hurt

- anger is secondary emotions,
  - the primary emotion is frustration
  - frustration is wanting smth and not getting it


- demand: "I've got to have my way" a
- blame: "you are the problem, you are what's wrong"
- this automatically sucks you into the drama


- you experience the emotion of frustration due to your rigid beliefs and thinking

- the message in frustration and disappointment is that your brain believes you
  could be doing better than you currently are

- frustration is very different from disappointment
  - disappointment: you want smth, but you will never get it
  - frustration: the solution is within range, but what you are currently doing isn't working
