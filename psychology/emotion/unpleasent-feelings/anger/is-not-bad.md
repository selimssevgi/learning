# angry

- is not bad

- there is unfairness in the world
  - there are cruel, selfish people in the world

- is not only OK to be angry when we are treated poorly, it is right to be angry
  when we are treated poorly


- just as your fear alerts you to danger, your anger alerts you to injustice

- one of the ways your brain communicates to you that you have had enough

- it energizes you to confront that injustice
