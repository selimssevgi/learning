# death

- two basic defenses:
  - deep belief both in personal inviolability
  - in existence of a uniquely personal, ultimate rescuer

- specialness: limits, agin, death may apply to them but not to oneself

- denial: child associate death with old age, refusing to get old

- death is fearful because it re-evokes separation anxiety (from mother)

- kierkegaard: man limited and diminished himself in order to avoid perception
  of the terror, perdition, and annihilation that dwell next door to any man

- rank: described neurotic one who refused to loan (life) in order to avoid the
  payment of the debt (death)

- paul tillich: neurosis is the way of avoiding non-being by avoiding being


## 2 fundamental defeneses against death

- mike(individuation): believed deeply in his specialness and personal inviolability
  - mike's sense of self-sufficiency was hypertrophied

- sam(fusion): put faith in the existence of an ultimate rescuer
  - sam did not exist alone but strove to fuse with another

- the human being either fuses or separates, embeds or emerges

- he affirms his autonomy by "standing out from nature", or seeks safety by merging with another force
- either he becomes his own father, or he remains the eternal son

- mike and sam have character disorders
  - mike -> schizoid
  - sam -> passive-dependency

- mike can be viewed from vantage points of:
  - a continued rebellious confict with parents
  - counterdependency
  - neurotic perpetuation of oedipal struggly
  - homosexual panic

- sam can be grasped from vantage points of:
  - identification with mother and unresolved grief
  - castration anxiety
  - from a family dynamic


### specialness

- compulsive heroism
  - heroic individuation represents the best that man can do in lifht of his existential situation

- the workaholic
  - works or applies himself not cus he wishes to but cus he *has* to
  - may push himself without mercy and without regards for human limits
  - leisure time is a time of anxiety and often frantically filled with some acitivity that conveys an illusion of accomplishment
  - living, thus, becomes equated with *becoming* or *doing*
  - time not spent in becoming is not living but waiting for life to commence
  - a frantic fight with time may be indicative of a powerful death fear

- narcissism

- aggression and control

- 3 categories of value orientations:

1. being:
  - emphazies the activity rather than the goal
  - spontaneous natural expression of the "is-ness" of personality

2. being-in-becoming
  - shares the being orientation
  - what a person is rather than on what the person can accomplish
  - emphazies on concept of development

3. doing
  - emphazies on accomplishments measurable by standards outside of the acting individual

#### the defense of specialness: faltering and anxiety

- maladaptive forms of individualistic or agentic solution
- a runaway heroic individualism (with its attendant dread of any sign of human frailty)
- a compulsive workaholic solution
- a depression ensuing from an interruption of the eternal spiral upward
- a severe narcissistic character disorder with its accompanying problematic
  interpersonal ramifications and maladaptive aggressive and controlling


- individualism, separation from nature
- being your own father, your own god may fail at times, not easy to head life alone in isolation
- back to ultimate rescuer

### ultimate resucer

- attempted to conquer time, to fix it permanently by remaining a child forever

- devoted herself to avoiding individuation and sought safety by attempting to
  submerge herself in a protector

- during her first months in the group the members assumed the task of keeping Lene alive, keeping her eating, keeping her from suicide
- therapist wondered: "does anything good ever happen to Lena?"


#### the collapse of the rescuer

- fatal illnesses
- depression
  - live a type of mediated existince: not for themselves, for either the "dominant other" or "dominant goal"

- many patients, rather than question their basic belief system, conclude that
  they are too worthless or too bad to warrant the love and protection of the
  ultimate rescuer

- masochism
  - to be punished was to be protected

- the rescuer defense and interpersonal difficulties
  - staying in unhealthy relationship being scared of being alone, lonely, dying alone

## toward an integrated view of psychopathology

- life fear and death fear

- fear of life is the fear of having to face life as an isolated being, it is
  the fear of individuation, of going forward, of standing out from nature

- the individual attempts to separate himself, to individuate, to affirm his
  autonomy, to go forward, to fulfill his potential. yet there comes a time when
  he develops fear in the face of life

- individuation, emergence, or, affirmation of specialness are not duty-free
- they entail a fearful, lonely sense of unprotectedness
- a sense that the individual assuages by reversing direction: one goes
  "backward", relinquishes individuation, finds comfort in fusing, in dissolving oneself,, in giving oneself up to another


- *life anxiety* emerges from the defense of specialness:
  - it is the price one pays for standing out, unshielded, from nature

- *dead anxiety* is the toll of fusion
  - when one gives up autonomy, one loses oneself and suffers a type of death


### the cost of neurotic adaptation

- behavior becomes "neurotic" when it is extreme and rigid

- self-restriction is not the end of the cost of neurotic adaptation

- another source of guilt: 
  - transgression against oneself, the failure to live the life alloted to one

- "when we protect ourselves, from a too intensive or too quick living out or
  living up, we feel ourselves guilty on account of the unused life, the unlived life in us"


- repression is a double-edged sword:
  - it provides safety and relief from anxiety
  - it generates life restriction and form of guilt



- field-defendent vs field-independent
- locus of control: internal vs external


- field dependence, external locus of control, orientation toward an ultimate rescuer
- field independence, internal locus of control, orientation toward personal specialness

## death and psychotherapy

- death awareness may act as a "boundary situation" and instigate a radical shift in life perpective
- death is a primary source of anxiety

#### death as a boundary situation

- boundary situation is an event, an urgent experience

- "though the pyhsicality of death destroys an individual, the idea of death can save him"

- a catalyst that can move one from one state of being to a higher one:
  - from a state of wondering about *how* things are
  - to a state of wonderment *that* they are
