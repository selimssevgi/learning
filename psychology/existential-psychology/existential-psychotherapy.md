# existential psychotherapy


- is a dynamic approach to therapy which focuses on concerns that are rooted in
  the individual's existince


- freud's major contribution to the understanding of the human being is his dynamic model of mental functioning
  - a model that posits that there are forces in conflict within the individual
  - that thought, emotion, behavior both adaptive and psychopathological, are the resultant of theese conflicting forces
  - these conflicting forces exist at varying levels of awareness, some indeed are entirely unconscious


- individual's confrontation with the givens of existence

- how does one discover the nature of these givens?
  - the method is deep personal reflection
  - the conditions are simple: solitude, silence, time and freedom from the every day dsitrictions


- 4 ultimate concerns:

1. death
  - conflict between the awareness of inevitability of death and wish to continue to be
2. freedom
  - conflict between confrontation with groundlessness and our wish for ground and structure
3. isolation
  - between our awareness of our absolute isolation and our wish for contact,
    for proctection, our wish to be part of a larger whole
4. meaninglessness
  - a meaning-seeking creature who is thrown into a universe that has no meaning


- drive -> anxiety -> defenese mechanism
- awareness of ultimate concern -> anxiety -> defenese mechanism

- the futre-becoming-present is the primary tense of existential therapy

- wise madness or foolish sanity?

- searching for a lost key, not in the dark alley where he dropped it but under
  a lamppost where the light was better


## chapter 2: life, death, and anxiety

- "no man enjoy the true taste of life but he who is willing and ready to quit" -- seneca

- although the physicality of death destroys man, the idea of death saves him

- heidegger believed that there are two fundamental modes of existing in the world:

1. a state of forgetfulness of being - inauthenticity
2. a state of mindfulness of being - authenticity

- death is the condition that makes it possible for us to live life in an authentic fashion

- chinese pictogram for "crisis" is a combinaton of two words: "danger" and "possibility"
