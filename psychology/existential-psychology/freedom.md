# freedom

- i can't => I wont

### responsibility

- the world acquired significance only through the way it is constituted by the human being

- nothing in the world has significance except by virtue of one's own creation

- *groundlessness* is a commonly used term for a subjective experience of responsibility awareness

* responsibility-avoiding defenses:
  - compulsivity
  - displacement of responsibility to another (paranoid)
  - denial of responsibility (innocent victim, losing control)
  - avoidance of autonomous behavior (is frightening to be one's own father)
  - decisional pathology


#### responsibility assumption

- you have created your own distress, it is *NOT*
  - chance
  - bad luck
  - bad genes

- that caused you to be:
  - lonely
  - isolated
  - chronically abused
  - insomniac


#### existential guilt

- when the person denies his potentialities, fails to fulfill them, his condition is guilt

- is a positive constructive force, a guide calling onself back to oneself


## willing


```shell

I can will
knowledge, but not wisdom;
going to bed, but not sleeping;
eating, but not hunger;
meekness, but not humility;
scrupulosity, but not virtue;
self-assertion or bravado, but not courage;
lust, but not love;
commiseration, but not sympathy;
congratulations, but not admiration;
religiosity, but not faith;
reading, but not understanding.
```
