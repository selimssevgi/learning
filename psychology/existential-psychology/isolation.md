# isolation

- recognize:
  - we are finite
  - we must die
  - we are free
  - we cannot escape our freedom


- 3 types of isolation:

1. interpersonal
2. intrapersonal
3. existential


### existential isolation

- separation from the world

- thrown into the world

- aloneness and helplessness

- using other people as tool not to face existential isolation

- it is the facing of aloneness that ultimately allows one to engage another deeply and meaningfully
