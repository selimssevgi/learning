# meaninglessness

- alturism
- a cause
- creativty
- hedonistic
- self-actualization

- 3 categories of life meaning:

1. what one accomplishes or gives to the world in terms of one's creation
2. what one takes from the world in terms of encounters and experiences
3. one's stand toward suffering, toward a fate that one cannot change


- modern man's dilemma:
  1. one is not told by instinct what one *must* do
  2. any longer by tradition what one *should* do
  3. nor does one know what one *wants* to do

- two common behavioral reactions to this crisis:

1. conformity (doing what others do)
2. submission to totalitarianism (doing what others wish)


- crusadism: powerful inclination to seek out and to dedicate oneself to dramatic and important causes
- nihilism: an active, pervasive proclivity to discredit activities supported by others to have meaning
- vegetative: why doing anything? what for? indifference, apathy
