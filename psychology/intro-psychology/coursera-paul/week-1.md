## dualism

## neurons

- they sum up and transmit information

- sensory neurons
- motor neurons
- interneurons (connecting neurons)

- they are all or nothing

- there is a gap between neurons

- drugs affect the chemicals in the gap

## parts of the brain

- you dont need your brain for everything

- cerebral cortex, has two halves


## two brains

## a bit of humility

- mind = brain

- the mind is a computer
  - recognition, language, motor control, logic ...

- but the hard problem of consciousness
  - subjective experience, qualia

- metarialism calls for a "mechanistic conception of mental life"

- but what about humanist values?
  - free will, responsibility, instrictic value, spiritual value


## sigmund freud

- unconscious motivation
  - unconscious reasons for feelings and actions

- unconscious dynamics
  - conflict between different systems in the brain leading to dreams, speech errors
