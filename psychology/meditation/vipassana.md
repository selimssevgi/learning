# vipassana

- is looking into somth with clarity and precision, seeing each component as
  disntinct, and percing all the way though to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing

- in vipassana medidation we cultivate this speicial way of seeing life. we
  train ourselves to see reality eactly as it is and we call this speical mode
  of perception *mindfullness*

- is oldest of buddhist medidation practices

- is a direct and gradual cultivation of mindfulness or awareness

- a set of exercises dedicated to the purpose of becoming more and more aware of
  your own life experience

  - it is attentive listening, mindful seeing, and careful testing

- in vipassana midedation we train ourselves to ignore the constant impulses to
  be more comfortable, and dive into reality instead

- when you drop your hectic pursuit of gratification, the real beauty of life comes out

- when you seek to know reality without illusion, complete with all its pain and
  danger, real freedom and security will be yours

- it is a cumulative function:
  - the more you sit, the more you learn about the real nature of your own existance

- the recommended procedure is as follows:
  - when we as meditators perceive any sensory object, we are not to dwel upon it in the ordinary egoistic way
  - we should rather examine the very process of perception itself
  - we should watch what that object does to our senses and our perception
  - we whould watch the feelings that arise and the emntal activities that follow
  - we whould note the changes that occur in our own conscuousness as a result
