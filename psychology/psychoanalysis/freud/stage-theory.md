# stage theory

 - psychosexual stages

- freud's stages of personality development associated with erogenous zones:

1. oral (brith 1 year) - breast feeding
2. anal (1-3 years) - toilet training
3. phallic (3-5 years) - genital, masculinity
4. latency (5 years - puberty)
5. genital (puberty on)

### fixation

- if you get into a problem at a certain stage, if you dont adequately resolve
  the problems posed by that stage, you could end up stuck there, fixated there.
