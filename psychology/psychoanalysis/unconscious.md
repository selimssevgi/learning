# unconscious functions


- conservative
  - the unconscious stores memories, often unaccessible to voluntary recall

- dissolutive:
  - the unconscious contains habits, once voluntary, now automaticized, and
    dissociated elements of the personality, which may lead a "parasitic existence"

- creative:
  - the unconscious serves as the matrix of new ideas

- mythopoetic:
  - the unconscious constructs narratives and fantasies that appear mythic or
    religious in nature
