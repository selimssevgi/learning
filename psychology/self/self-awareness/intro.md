# self awareness

- self-analysis can trap us in a mental hell of our own making

- introspection may be depressing, but it is worth it because of the insight it produces

- thinking about ourselves isn't related to knowing ourselves

- when we ask "WHY?", it doesn't lead us towards the truth about ourselves, it leads us away from it

- asking "WHY?" creates "alternative facts" 
  - it clouds our self-perception

- "WHAT"


- *Why* me?
- *What* is most important to me?

- *Why* do I feel so terrible?
- *What* situations make me feel terrible and *what* do they have in common?
