# self-efficacy

- developing a competency of any kind strengthens the sense of self-efficacy,
  making a person a more willing to take risks and seek out more demanding challenges 

- Albert bandura, a stanford psychologist
  - people's beliefs about their abilities have a profound effect on those abilities
  - they approach things in terms of how to handle them rather than worriying
    about what can go wrong
