# six pillars of self-esteem

- if self-esteem is the health of the mind

- the stability we cannot find in the world we must create within our own persons

## part 1 - self-esteem: basic principles

### self-esteem: the immune system of consciousness

- self esteem is:

1. confidence in our ability to think, confidence in our ability to cope with
   the basic challenges of life

2. confidence in our right to be successful and happy, the feeling of being
   worthy, deserving, entitled to assert our needs and wants, achieve our
   values, and enjoy the fruits of our efforts


- level of self-esteem influences how we act,
- how we act influences the level of our self-esteem

- to trust one's mind and to know that one is worthy of happiness is the essence of self-esteem

- the value of self-esteem lies not merely in the fact that it allows us to *feel*
  better but that it allows us to *live* better

- high self-esteem seeks the challenge and stimulation of worthwhile and
  demanding goals. reaching such goals nurtures good self-esteem

- the more solid our self-esteem, the better equipped we are to cope with
  troubles that arise in our personal lives or in our careers

- the quicker we are to pick ourselves up after a fall; the more energy we have to begin anew

- an important principle of human relationships is that we tend to feel most
  comfortable, most "at home", with people whose self-esteem level resembles our own

- there is no greater barrier to romantic happiness than the fear that i am
  undeserving of love and that my destiny is to be hurt


- if i do not accept myself, how can i accept your love for me?

- if you love me, obviously you are not good enough for me, only someone who
  will reject me is an acceptable object of my devotion

- what is required for many of us, paradoxical though it may sound, is the
  courage to tolerate happiness without self-sabotage

- the anxiety of feeling out of control is unbearable, i must end it any way i can

- generosity toward the achievements of others is emblematic of self-esteem

- it would be hard to name a more certain sign of poor self-esteem than the need
  to perceive some other group as inferior

- the form of the explosion is self-destructive behavior
- the fact that one may have an extraordinary intelligence is no protection


#### self-fulfilling prophecies

- self-esteem creates a set of implicit expectations about what is possible and appropriate to us

- self-esteem --high or low-- tends to be a generator of self-fulfilling prophecies

- regardless of the context in which self-destructive behavior occurs, or the
  form it takes, the motor of such behavior is the same: poor self-esteem

- it is poor self-esteem that places us in an adversarial relationship to our well-being

- when self-esteem is low, our resilience in the face of life's adversities is diminished

- when self-esteem is low, our resilience in the face of life's adversities is diminished
- we tend to be more influenced by the desire to avoid pain than to experience joy

- high self-esteem people can surely be knocked down by an excess of troubles,
  but they are quicker to pick themselves up again

- positive self-esteem, in effect, the immune system of consciousness
  - providing resistance, strength, and a capacity for regeneration
  

- persons of high self-esteem are not driven to make themselves superior to
  others; they do not seek to prove their value by measuring themselves against a comparative standard
  

- if my aim is to prove I am "enough", the project goes on to infinity, cus the
  battle was already lost on the day i conceded the issue was debatable

- when we have unconflicted self-esteem, joy is our motor, not fear. it is
  happiness that we wish to experience, not suffering that we wish to avoid

- if we lack adequate self-esteem, the amount of choice offered to us today can be frightening

### the meaning of self-esteem

- self-esteem has two interrelated components:

1. sense of basic confidence in the face of life's challenges: self-efficacy
  - self-trust; self-reliance
2. sense of being worthy of happiness: self-respect


- self-esteem is the disposition to experience oneself as competent to cope with
  the basic challenges of life and as worthy of happiness


- in a world in which the total of human knowledge is doubling about every ten
  years, our security can rest only on our ability to learn

- self-respect entails the expectation of friendship, love and happiness as
  natural, as a result of who we are and what we do

- we need to trust ourselves and we need to admire ourselves, and the trust and
  admiration need to be grounded in reality, not generated out of fantasy and self-delusion

- self-esteem contemplates what needs to be done and says: *I can*
- pride contemplates what has been accomplished and says: *I did*

- we can feel pride while owning and accepting what jungians call our *Shadow*

### the face of self-esteem

- relaxation implies that we are not hiding from ourselves and are not at war with who we are

### self-esteem in action

- healthy self-esteem is significantly correlated with:
  - rationality
  - realism
  - intuitiveness
  - creativity (they value the productions of their mind)
  - independence
  - flexibility
  - ability to manage change
  - willingness to admit (and correct) mistakes
  - benevolence
  - cooperativeness

- high self-esteem is intrinsically reality oriented

### the illusion of self-esteem

- when self-esteem is low, we are often manipulated by fear

- our feelings tend to encourage or discourage thinking
  - to draw us toward facts, truth, and reality
  - or away from them
  - toward efficacy or away from it


- we are challenged to raise the level of our consciousness in the face of emotional resistance

- the base and motor of poor self-esteem is not confidence but fear
- not to leave but to escape the terror of life, is the fundamental goal
- not creativity but safety is the ruling desire

- self-esteem is an intimate experience; it resides in the core of one's being
- it is what i think and feel about myself, not what someone else thinks or feels about me

## part 2 - internal sources of self-esteem

### the focus on action

- what determines the level of self-esteem is what the individual does


* six pillars of self-esteem:

1. the practice of living consciously
1. the practice of self-acceptance
1. the practice of self-responsibility
1. the practice of self-assertiveness
1. the practice of living purposefully
1. the practice of personal integrity


### the practise of living consciously

- we identify increasing maturity with wider vision, greater awareness, higher consciousness

- our mind is our basic tool of survival, betray it and self-esteem suffers

- self-esteem is the reputation we acquire with ourselves

- fear and pain should be treated as signals not to close our eyes but to open them wider

- do i know what i am oding when i particularly like myself and what i am doing when i dont?

#### consciousness and the body

- when feelings and emotions are blocked and repressed, the process of implementation is physical

- work to release the breathing and open areas of tight muscular contraction,
  the person feels more and is more aware.

- body work can liberate blocked consciousness

- freeing the body contributes to freeing the mind

#### sentence completions




- we tend to be more conscious in some areas of our life than in others

- we look at the area where our life is working least satisfactorily
- we notice where the pains and frustrations are
- we observe where we feel least effective


### the practice of self-acceptance

- without self-acceptance, self-esteem is impossible

- self-esteem is smth we experience, self-acceptance is smth we do

#### the first level

- "i choose to value myself, to treat myself with respect, to stand up for my right to exist"

#### the second level

- it is our willingness to experience rather than to disown whatever may be the
  facts of our being at a particular moment

- i may not be in the mood to work today; i can acknowledge my feelings,
  experience them, accept them. and then go to work

- i will work with a clearer mind because i have not begun the day with self-deception

- often, we we fully experience and accept negative feelings, we are able to let
  go of them, they have been allowed to have their say and they relinquish center stage

- self-acceptance is the willingness to say of any or behavior:

```
this is an expression of me, not necessarily an expression i like or admire, but
an expression of me nonetheless, at least at the time it occurred
```

- i am feeling what i am feeling and i accept the reality of my experience

- experiencing our feelings has direct healing power

- self-acceptance is the precondition of change and growth

- i cannot forgive myself for an action i will not acknowledge having taken

- i cannot overcome a fear whose reality I deny

- it is not acceptance but denial that leaves me stuck

- I cannot be truly for myself, cannot build self-esteem, if i cannot accept myself

### the third level

- self-acceptance entails the idea of compassion, of being a friend to myself

- accepting, compassionate interest does not encourage undesired behavior but
  reduces the likelihood of it recurring

- mirror self-acceptance exercise

#### listening to feelings

- the act of experiencing and accepting our emotions is implemented through:

1. focusing on the feeling or emotion
2. breathing gently and deeply, allowing muscles to relax, allowing feeling to be felt
3. making real that this is my feeling (which we call owning it)

- we deny or disown our emotions when we:

1. avoid awareness of their reality
2. constrict our breathing and tighten our muscles to cut off or numb feeling
3. disassociate ourselves from our own experience (often unable to recognize our feelings)


- angry woman, husband leaving for business trip
- feeling the angry bring anxiety
- feeling anxiety bring the fear of being alone
- afraid of what she might do when he's gone, other man, she does not trust herself


* an experiment

take a few minutes to comtemplate some feeling or emotion of yours that is not easy for you to face (insecurity, pain, envy, rage, sorrow, humiliation, fear)

when you isolate the feeling, see if you can bring it into clearer focus, perhaps by thinking or imagining whatever typically evokes it.
 then breathe into the feeling, which means focus on the feeling while imagining you are directing the flow of air to it and then from it.
 imagina what it would fee like not to resist this feeling but to accept it fully.

"I am now feeling such and such (whatever the feeling is) and I accept it fully"

"A fact is a fact; that which is, is; if the feeling exists, it exists"

"I am now exploring the world of fear or pain or envy or confusion (or whatever)"


- when we fight a block it grows stronger, when we acknowledge, experience, and
  accept it, it begins to melt


- acceptance of what is, is the precondition of change
- denial of what is leave me stuck in it


- the greatest crime we commit against ourselves is not that we may deny and
  disown our shortcomings but that we deny and disown our greatness, cus it frightens us

### the practice of self-responsibility

- i am responsible for the achievement of my desires
  - what am i willing to do to get what I want?

- I am responsible for my choices and actions
  - if I take full responsibility for my choices and actions ---

- i am responsible for the level of consciousness I bring to my work

- i am responsible for the level of consciousness I bring to my relationships

- i am responsible for my behavior with other people
  - she is driving me crazy
  - he pushes my buttons
  - I would reasonably if only she would ...

- i am responsible for how I prioritize my time

- i am responsible for the quality of my communications

- i am responsible for my personal happiness

- i am responsible for accepting or choosing the values by which I live

- i am responsible for raising my self-esteem


- if i hold myself responsible for matters beyond my control, I put my
  self-esteem in jeopardy, since inevitably i will fail my expectations

### the practice of self-assertiveness

- means honoring my wants, needs, and values and seeking appropriate forms of their expression in reality

- self-assertiveness means the willingness to stand up for myself, to be who i
  am openly, to treat myself with respect in all human encounters

- to ask questions is an act of self-assertions
- to challenge authority is an act of self-assertions
- to think for oneself, and to stand by what one thinks, is the root of self-assertion

- my life does not belong to others and i am not here on earth to live up to someone else's expectations

### the practice of self-purposefully

- leave hoping and wishing for children

- to live without purpose is to live at the mercy of change

- productive work has the potential of being a powerful self-esteem building activity

- daydreams do not produce the experience of efficacy

- our achievements are not the measure or grounds of our self-esteem
- the root of our self-esteem is not our achievements but those internally
  generated practices that, among other things, make it possible for us to achieve

- the power lies in the source of wealth, not in the wealth

- productive achievement may be an expression of high self-esteem, but it is not its primary cause

- a person may hide behind work in order to evade feelings of shame and guilt
  stemming from other areas of life so that productive work becomes not so much
  a healthy passion as an avoidance strategy, a refuge from realities one feels
  frightened to face

- if a person makes the error of identifying self with his work (rather than
  with the internal virtues that make the work possible), if self-esteem is tied
  primarily to accomplishments, success, income, or being a good family
  provider, the danger is that economic circumstances beyond the individual's
  control may lead to the failure of the business or the loss of a job, flinging
  him into depression or acute demororalization

- it takes an unusual kind of person to avoid falling into the trap of this
  error. it takes a person who is already well centered and who understands that
  some of the forces operating are beyond personal control, and do not have (or
  should not have) significance for self-esteem

- it is not that they may not suffer or feel anxiety for the future; it is that
  they do not interpret the problem in terms of personal worth

- if our aim is self-expression rather than self-justification, the balance
  tends to come more naturally

- if i dont do smth, nothing is going to change

- for self-esteem, consistent kindness by intention is a very different
  experience from kindness by impulse

### the practice of personal integrity

- observe that before the issue of integrity can even be raised we need
  principles of behavior, moral convictions about what is and is not appropriate

- self-acceptance is a precondition of change or improvement

- when we behave in ways that conflict with our judgment of what is appropriate,
  we lose face in our own eyes

- I act against my judgment, I betray my mind

- if I am uniquely situated to raise my self-esteem, I am also uniquely situated to lower it

- i can avoid people who have learned the humiliating truth about me. I cannot avoid myself

- the protection of self-esteem requires a clear understanding of the limits of personal responsibility

- where there is no power, there can be no responsibility, 
- where there is no responsibility, there can be no reasonable self-reproach
- regret, yes; guilt, no.

- five steps are needed to restore one's sense of integrity with regards to a particular breach

1. we must own the fact that it is we who have taken the particular action. we
   must face and accept the full reality of what we have done, without disowning
   or avoidance. we own, we accept, we take responsibility

2. we seek to understand why we did what we did. we do this compassionately, but without evasive alibiing

3. if others are involved, as they often are, we acknowledge explicitly to the
   relevant person or persons the harm we have done. we convey our understanding
   of the consequences of our behavior. we acknowledge how they have been
   affected by us. we convey understanding of their feelings

4. we take any and all actions available that might make amends for or minimize the harm we have done

5. we firmly commit ourselves to behaving differently in the future

- when guilt is a consequnece of failed integrity, nothing less than an act of
  integrity can redress the breach


#### what if our values are irrational?

- we may accept or absorb a code of values that does violence to our nature and needs

```
once we see that living up to our standards appears to be leading us toward
self-destruction, the time has come to question our standards
```

### the philosophy of self-esteem

- no other individual or group has the power to determine how i will think and feel about myself

- I need to be on the lookout for temptations to evade unpleasant facts; i need
  to manage my avoidance impulses and not be rules by them

- i accept the reality of my problems, but i am not defined by them. my problems
  are not my essense. my fear, pain, confusion, or mistakes are not my core


- my self-esteem is more valuable than any short-term rewards for its betrayal

- consciousness is reliable; knowledge is attinable; reality is knowable

- relationships based on an exchange of values are superior to those based on
  the sacrifice of anyone to anyone

## part 3 - external influences: self and others

### nurturing a child's self-esteem

- if differences are accepted, self-esteem can grow

- inappropriate praise can be as harmful to self-esteem as inappropriate criticism

- evaluate praise(you are good boy) vs appreciative praise (the books are all in order now...)

- criticism needs to be directed only at the chil'd behavior, never at the child
- describe the behavior (hitting a sibling, breaking a promise)
- describe your feelings about it (anger, disappointment)
- describe what you want done (if anything)

- no good purpose is ever served by assaulting a child's self-esteem
- we do not inspire better behavior by impugning a child's worth, intelligence,
  morality, character, intentions, or psychology

- no one was ever made "good" by being informed he or she was "bad"

- attacks on self-esteem tend to incrase the likelihood that the unwanted behavior will happen again
  - "since i am bad, i will behave badly"

### self-esteem in the schools


- we can learn to recognize and accept our emotions without losing our minds

- we know that appropriate self-assertiveness can enrich, not subvert, team
  efforts, and that feat of assertiveness can sabotage them

- we know that no human interaction can be optionally successful if one or both
  parties are afraid of normal self-assertiveness and self-expression

### self-esteem and work

- primary meaning of self-esteem: it is confidence in the efficacy of our mind, in our ability to think

- today, what we is no longer "management" and "workers" but an integration of specialists

- interpersonal competence is a high priority
- low self-esteem tends to stand in the way of such compotence

- an overattachment to the known and familiar has become costly and dangerous;
  it threatens both organizations and individuals with obsolescense

- just enough self-esteem to maintain a decent level of competence within the
  framework that existed, but not so much self-esteem as to challenge basic
  company values or policies

- what company promised in exchange was lifetime protection and security
- "be a company man and the company will take care of you"


- freedom means change; the ability to manage change is at least in part of a function of self-esteem

- americans refusing to see japanese development after WWII
- when a self-doubting, insecure person blindly persist in counterproductive
  behavior, clings to illusory safey of compulsive inflexibility, and blames all
  misfortune on someone else

- from the boardroom to the factory floor, work is understood more and more
  clearly as an expression of thought

- capitalism created a market for the independent mind

- if high self-esteem correlates with comfort in managing change and in letting
  go of yesterday's attachments, then high self-esteem confers a competitive edge


- a commitment to lifelong learning is a natural expression of the practice of living consciously

- "is this an organization where I can learn, grow, develop myself, enjoy my work?"
- "is this a place that supports my self-esteem? -- or does violence to it?"


- when the behavior of someone creates a problem, ask them to propose a
  solution, whenever possible avoid handing down solutions but give the problem
  to the responsible part, thereby encouraging self-responsibility,
  self-assertiveness, and intensified awareness

- educate your people to see problems as challenges and opportunities; this is
  one perspective clearly shared by high achievers and by people of high self-esteem


- a mind that distrusts itself cannot inspire the best in the minds of others,
- niether can leaders inspire the best in others if their primary need, arising
  from their insecurities, it to prove themselves right and others wrong

- is a leader who is a 5 more likely to hire a 7 or a 3?
- very likely he/she will feel more comfortable with 3, since people often feel
  intimated by others more confident than themselves

### self-esteem and psychotherapy

- sometimes problems could be understood as direct expressions of an underdeveloped self-esteem
  - shyness, timidity, fear of self-assertion, intimacy

- sometimes problems could be understood as consequences of the *denial* of poor self-esteem
- defenses built against the reality of the problem

- controlling and manipulative behavior, obssessive-compulsive rituals,
  inappropriate aggressiveness, fear-driven sexuality, destructive forms of ambition
- all aiming to produce some experience of efficacy, control and personal worth

- the problems that were manifestations of poor self-esteem were also
  contributors to the continuing deterioration of self-esteem

- "how do you feel about yourself when you avoid an issue you know, at some
  level, needs to be dealt with? and how you feel about yourself when you master
  your avoidance impulses and confront the threatening issue?"

- learning to face and master rather than withdraw and avoid

- detective work: the crime is know, the challenge is to discover the identity of the criminal
- psychoanalyst: the criminal is known and the challenge is to discover the crime

- everyone who has any familiarity with psychology knows about the danger of
  disowning the murderer within. far fewer people understand the tragedy of
  disowning the hero within

- in psychotherapy, it is often easy enought to see the part of the individual
  that is neurotic, the challenge is to see and mobilize that part that is healthy

- when a psychotherapist wishes to assist in the development of healthy
  self-esteem, an understanding of the dynamics of subpersonalities is an invaluable tool

- the healing that is needed is not between self and others but between adult-self and child-self

- unhealing pain from the past represents yet another barrier in the quest for stronger self-esteem

- when we eliminate negatives, we clear the way for the emergence of positives,
  and when we cultivate positives, negatives often weaken or dissapear


### self-esteem and culture

- self-esteem requires self-acceptance; it is not served by self-rejection

- cooperation is not a "middle ground" betweeen self-assertiveness and
  self-suppression, but the intelligent exercise of self-interest in a social
  context, which does have to be learned

- a proper human life is one in which we seeks the fullest exercise of our distinctive powers

- genuine self-esteem is what we feel about ourselves when everything is not all right

### conclusion: the seventh pillar of self-esteem

- laziness
- the impulse to avoid discomfort

- living consciously may obligate us to confront our fears; it may bring us into contact with unresolved pain.

- self-acceptance may require that we make real to ourselves thoughts, feelings,
  or actions that disturb our equilibrium

- if one of our top priorities is to aviod discomfort, if we make this a higher
  value than our self-regards, then under pressure we will abandon the six
  practices precisely when we need them most

- the desire to avoid discomfort is not, per se, a vice

- first we avoid what we need to look at because we do not want to feel pain
- then our avoidance produces further problems for us, which we also do not want to look at because they evoke pain
- which we also do not want to look at cus they evoke pain
- then new avoidance produces additional problems we do not care to examine -- and so on

- layer of avoidance is piled on layer of avoidance, disowned pain on disowned pain
