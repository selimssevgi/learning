# 5 hindrances

- 5 different states of minds

1. *sensual desire* (positive emotions from seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling)
  - climbing mountain, on the way, a restaurant with delicious food 
  - sensual desire -> obsession


2. *ill will / aversion* (negative emotions, dislike to object, situation, person)
  - starts to rain while climbing
  - let go of ill will

3. *dullness / heaviness* (dullness of mind, heaviness of body, sleepiness)
  - no motivation, lack of energy
  - state of depression
  - imprisonment


4. *restlessness*
  - unsettled mind (worrying about future, rejecting past)
  - monkey mind, constantly jumping from branch to branch

5. *skeptical doubt*
  - lost in thoughts
  - what if this and what if that
  - getting disconnected from own goals
  - too much doubts, more often you will stop instead of moving forward


- align and structure your life in such a way to prevent hindrances from arising
