# thinking fast and slow

- mind
  - fast(automatic) thinking - intuition - associative memory
  - slow(effortful) thinking - - controlled

- self
  - experiencing self
  - remembering self


## two system

### characters of the story

- looking at an angry woman face (system1)
- looking at a multiplication problem (system2)


- system1: operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control

- system2: allocates attention to effortful mental activities
  - th operations of system2 are often associated with the subjective experience
    of agency, choice and concentration

- in system1, knowledge is stored in memory and accessed without intention and effeort

- system2 has some ability to change the way system1 works, by programming the
  normally automatic functions of attention and memory

- gorilla experiment: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness

- system1 continuously generates suggestions for system2:
  - impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings

- system2 in also credited with the continous monitoring of your own behavior

- most of what you (your system2) think and do originates in your system1, but
  system2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word

- system 1 has biases, sometimes answers easier questions than the one it was asked

- one further limitation of system1 is that it cannot be turned off

- conflict between an automatic reaction and an intention to control

- one of the tasks of system2 is to overcome the impulses of system1. in order
  words, system2 is in charge of self-control

- MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion: two equal line, visually one is shorter than the other

- cognitive illusion

- errors from system1 can be prevented only by enhanced monitoring and effortful acitivty of system2

#### attention and effort

- system2, its operations are effortful, one of its characteristics is laziness

- cognitive pupillometry

- in the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is
  driven by the balance of benefits and costs. laziness is built deep into our nature

- system2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several
  attributes, and make deliberate choces between options

### the lazy controller

- self-control and deliberate thought apparently draw on the same limited budget of effort

- "flow" neatly separates the two forms of effort:
  - concentration on the task (motocycle, chess)
  - the deliberate control of attention (no self-control, all resources to task)

### the busy and depleted system2

- both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work

- people who are simultaneously challenged by a demanding cognitive task and by
  a temptation are more likely to yield to the temptation

- system1 has more influence on behavior when system2 is busy

- self-control requires attention and effort
- controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that system2 performs

- the list of situations and tasks that are now known to deplete self-control is long varied
- all involve *conflict* and the need to *suppress* a natural tendency

### the lazy system 2

- one of the main functions of system2 is:
  - to monitor and control thoughts and actions "suggested" by ststem1
  - allowing some to be expressed directly in behavior
  - suppressing or modifying others

- the-bat-ball problem

- how closely system2 monitor system1?

- many people are overconfident, prone to place to much faith in their intuitions

- if system1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow

- memory function is an attribute of system1
- the extent of deliberate checking and search is a characteristic of system2, which varies among individuals

### intelligence, control, rationality

- if people were ranked by their self-control and by their cognitive aptitude,
  would individuals have similar positons in two ranking?


- system1 is impulsive and intuitive
- system2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some pople it is also lazy

- superficial or lazy thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality?

### the associative machine

- EAT -> SOUP
- WASH -> SOAP

- ripples

- florida effect

- *priming effect*

- the influencing of an action by the idea is known as *ideometer effect*

- what we think affect our behaviors, how we behave affect our thinking

### cognitive ease

- cognitive strain, requires system2

- ease:
  - repeated experience, clear display, primed idea, good mood
  - feels familiar, feels true, feels good, feels effortless


### the pleasure of cognitive ease

- it appears to be a feature of system1 that cognitive ease is associated with good feelings

- the more exposed/repeated, the more system 1 is at ease

- the link between positive emotion and cognitive ease in system1 has a long
  evolutionary history

### ease, mood, and intuition

- when are unconfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition


### how judgements happens

- direct measurable questions goes to system2, will direct attention and search
  memory to find the answers

- system2 receives questions or generates them

- system1 continuously monitors what is going on outside and inside the mind
