# venting

- someone happened to us (stressing, bad etc)

- and going to a separate person

- something bad happened at work
- you vent to your partner at home

## why people vent

- it feels good
  - let me vent, it will be fine, and i will move on
  - so cocain feels good too?

- venting not productive, further you away from solutions

- venting is the ego's way of avoiding accountability and self-reflection

- venting is a story our ego makes up. most of it never even happened

## what not to do

- not to the person caused it
  - cannot change the person
  - it will cause more issues
  - makes us go into a more hopeless place 
  - cannot change the person and their behavior
  - emphasizes things outside of our power, makes us more powerless

- better to reflect on how you experience that person's behavior
