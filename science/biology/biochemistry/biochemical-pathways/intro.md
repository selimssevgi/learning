# biochemical pathways

- fermentation: C6H12O6 -> CO2 + ethanol

- sugar -> A -> B -> C -> D ... -> CO2 + ethanol


- unfavorable reaction (delta G gt 0)
- favorable reaction (delta G lt 0)


## logical tricks

- direct coupling
  - A -> B (unfavorable)
  - C -> D (favorable)
  - unfavorable reaction coupled with a very favorable reaction(ATP -> ADP)
  - A + C -> B +D (favorable)

- indirectly coupled
  - A -> B (unfavorable)
  - B -> C (favorable)
  - jump from A to C


## glycolysis: break sugars

- *lysis* breaking

- doing it for ATP


## regulation of pathways

- allosteric regulation
  - enzym changes shape to slow down

## cellular respiration and fermentation
