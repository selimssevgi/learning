# parts of cell

- cellular membrane

- cylosol

- nucleus: separates dna from the rest of cell, membrane of dna
  - DNA
  - nucleolus/nucleole: produces ribosomal RNA

- ribosome: mRNA -> proteins

- endoplasmic reticulum: some of ribosomes are attached to
  - parts that are NO ribomes attached are called smooth E.R
  - parts that are ribomes attached are called rough E.R
  - attached ribosomes created proteins going inside ER
  - protein travels from there to Golgi bodies

- Golgi bodies: parts lets proteins go through membrane

- vesicle: wrapped in golgi(membrane) and floating in cylosol

- lysosomes: contain enzymes helping dissolves other things

- mitochondria: sugars are turned into ATP
  - has its own dna, can reproduce independently
