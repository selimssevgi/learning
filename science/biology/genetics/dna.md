# dna

- stores genetic instructions

- a molecular blueprint for a living thing
- dna -> rna -> protein -> cell

- one of its main function: to tell amino acids how to line up

- dna lives in nucleus

- amoni acids live outside the nucleus

- special chemicals inside the nucleus make partial copies of the dna code
  - these partial copies called rna(shorter, missing one of their sides)
  - so small can get out of nucleus 

- rna goes out to cytoplasm and into ribosome

- ribosomes are protein building machines
  - reads rna code 3 letters(tells which amino acids) at a time
  - sucks amino acids from their surroundings and stick them together
  - grows and grows into a protein

## replication - how copy

- helicase, unzips dna

- each strand can be used as a template for replication

## transcription

- mRNA

- mRNA is processed before going out

- transfer RNA molecules carry the amino acids to ribosome
