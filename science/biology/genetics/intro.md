# genetics intro

- genetics is the study of genes

- genes are made from a long molecule called DNA

- the language used by DNA is called the genetic code

- organisms read the information in genes, instructions for constructing and operating a living organism

- atom -> molecule -> nucleotides(A, C, T, G) -> DNA -> gene

- gene makes proteins

- dna acts as a blueprint, recipe for a living thing

- amino acids: building blocks of life, there are 20 different kinds
  - think them like logos
  - they can come together to create proteins
