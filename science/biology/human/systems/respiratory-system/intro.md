# respiratory system

- ventilatory system

- ventilation is normally unconscious and automatic, but can be overridden by conscious alternative patterns

- why is it much harder to breathe at higher altitudes? 

- what triggers initial breathing?

- what triggers breathing to go faster? -- respirator rate

## responsibility

1. it brings oxygen into our bodies
2. it helps us get rid of carbon dioxide

## alerts

- breathlessness
- cough
- chest pain

- it is set up to take full advantage of both bulk flow and simple diffusion

## diffusion vs bulk flow

- diffusion alone isn't enough to get the job done (too slow)

- bulk flow: public transport, bring in bunch, so they can diffuse in blood


## organs

### input

* conduction zone (brings air from external environment to lungs)
* respiratory zone

- nose
- mouth

- sinuses: warms and moistens incoming air, so it doesnt dry out lung cells

- pulmonary artiries: come directly from the right side of heart
  - they carry blood which is low in oxygen

- pulmonary veins: oxygen rich blood travels back into the left side of heart

- cilia: tiny hairs moving in wave-like to filter dust and irritants out of airways

- pharynx (throat): nose/mouth -> throat -> trachea

- larynx: voice box

- trachea (windpipe) (built like a vacuum hose)
  - lungs create negative pressure with every breath
  - trachea needs those rings to keep it open
  - passage connecting throat and lungs
  - epiglottis: flat at the entrance, closes when swallow

- bronchi (pipe): left and right bronchi, branching out from trachea

- alveoli: leaves of bronchi, tiny air sacs
  - gas exchange between air and blood

- lungs (they dont have any contractible muscle tissue, cus they need to be able to expand)
  - they require outside help: diaphragm
  - are very vascular organs, meaning they receive a very large blood supply

- ribs (protecting lungs)
- diaphragm: muscle that helps lungs pull in air and push it out

- blood

- bronchopulmonary segments
  - there are about 10 of them in each lung
  - each segment receives its own blood supply and air supply


* exchange of gases
  - external respiration (in lungs)
  - internal respiration (in cells)
