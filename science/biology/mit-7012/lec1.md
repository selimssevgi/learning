- we did not know %80 of what we know today(2004) in 1960s

- you cannot say that about mechanics, physics, circuit theory, electronics, chemistry

- discovery in 1953 by Watson and Crick of structure of the DNA double helix

- we make one large and major distinction between the two major life forms on
  the planet in terms of cells:

1. prokaryotic cells (lack nuclei) - protozoa represents single-cell organisms
2. eukaryotic cells (poses nuclei) - metazoa represents multi-cellular organisms

* zoa as in zoo means animal

- the appearance of humans represents a very small segment (1500 years) of the
  entire history of life on this planet(13-15 billion years old)

## nucleus

- term karion comes from greek meaning a seed or a kernel

- nucleus is what gives the eukaryotic cell its name

- within the nucleus are the chromosomes which carry DNA

- mitochondria have their own DNA in them

- mitochondria represent the essential sources of energy production in the cell
