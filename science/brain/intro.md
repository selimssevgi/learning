# brain

- brain is constantly creating all of the possible actions
  - all the ones you see others do
  - all the ones object around you would let you do

- brain suppresses those ideas
  - brain mades them all ready to go
  - brain holds them down (frontal lobe holds down all the things that you dont want to do)
