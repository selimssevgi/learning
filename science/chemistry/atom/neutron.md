# neutron (1932) 

- protons in the nucleus?
- protons are positively charged
- same charge repals each other
- then how so all protons are just staying together in nucleus?

## discovery of the neutron

- 1 Helium atom has 2 protons
- 1 Hydrogen atom has 1 proton = 2 H atoms have 2 protons in total

- so can we put 1 He and 2 H on two different side of the scale and they will be same?
- no, He is heavior, himm?


- how about 1 He and 4 H? yes they are balancing


- 1932, James Chadwick
