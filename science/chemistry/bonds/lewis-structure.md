# lewis structure

- key to bonding: e sharing to achieve a full valance shell

- electrons are distributed in such a way that each element is surrounded by eight electrons

- each dot in a lewist structure represents a valence e

- F has 7 valence electrons

- 2 F shares 1 electron from each to satisfy octet rule
