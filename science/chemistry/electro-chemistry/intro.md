# intro

- the relationship between chemical reactions and electricity

- certain chemical reactions can create electricity

- electricity can make certain chemical reactions happen that wouldn't happen otherwise
  - electrolysis
  - oxygen -> electrons -> hydrogen
  - this does not happen naturally
  - oxygen has a stronger pull for electrons
  - hydrogen has a weaker pull for electrons
  - a battery can pull the electrons from oxygen and push them to hydrogen
