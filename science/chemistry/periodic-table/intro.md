# periodic table of elements

- the origins of the elements - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJQjjBR6PbY

- 1860s, about 60 elements are known to mankind

- Mendeleev, master of the elements

- elements can be excited by heating them up or running electicity through them
  - neon: electrity

- each element in the universe glows with its own particular set of colors
  - you can think of these colors as a fingerprint or a bar code

- inside of galaxies, the basic building block of the universe are starts
- starts are giant balls of hydrogen and helium gas
- our sun giant balls of hydrogen and helium gas (fusion)
  - fusion: H + H: hydrogen bombs: human can cause, but in an uncontrolled way, can not use for electrity
  - fission: n -> uranium (atom): in controlled way, human get energy and use it as electrity

- in sun, 15 million temparature, hydrogen comes together to create helium
