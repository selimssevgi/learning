# hydrogen atom wavefunctions

- to describe an orbital, we need all 3 quantum numbers:

1. n - energy level(shell)
2. l - subshell (shape of orbital): s, p, d, f
3. m - orbital orientation (specific orbital): px, py, pz


- l = 0, s orbital, m = 0 is pz orbital, m+-1 are the px and py orbitals
- l = 1, p orbital
- l = 2, d orbital
- l = 3, f orbital
