# the wave-particle duality of light

1. light as a wave: characteristics of waves
2. light as a particle: the photoelectric effect

- speed of light = wave-length x frequency

- speed of light is a constant

- wave-length x frequency = 2.9979 x 10^8 m/s

- constructive(gets bigger) and destructive(straight line) interference
  - noise canceling headphones



- the energy of light is proportional to its frequency (Einstein - 1905)
- E = hv

- light is made up of energy "packets" called "photons"
- the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency
- intensity of light = photons per sec
