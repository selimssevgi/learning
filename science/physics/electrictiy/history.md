# history of electricity

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUUeGianTKM

- 1730: stephen gray: distinction between conduction and insulation
  - electricity could move


- 1745: pieter van mushin brook
  - store electricity in water (holding in hand) by accident
  - leyden(leiden) jar
  - modern equivalents: capacitor

- :benjamin franklin: lightning is electricity?
  - a pole in the middle of garden, bottom in a bottle of wine
  - after lightning, there is a leyden jar to prove, 
  
- :benjamin franklin: why leyden jar works when it was held in the hand
  - why didnt all the electricity just drain away
  - electricty as current in bank
  - electrical fluid: too much: positive, too little: negative
  - positve charge moves to cancel out negative charge
  - negative charges increase in water, positve charges increase in hand
  - trx cannot be done cus of glass

- 1759: galvani: using electriciy in medical treatments, using electrostatic charge
  - animal electriciy
  - frog experiment: claiming frog's body was leyden jar

- 1773: henry cavendish, how a fish has electricity like leyden jar but not cause spark?
  - distinction between the amount of electricity and its intensity
  - fish produced same kind of energy but just less intense
  - amount of electricity -> electric charge
  - its intensity -> potential difference or voltage
  - leyden jar: high voltage but low charge
  - fish: low voltage but high charge
  - animal electricity vs machine electricity
  - leap: electricity does not have to be as sock, can be continuous

- 1790: alessandro volta: electricity is not in frog's body itself, coming from somewhere else
  - going after the metals galvani was using
  - tasting combinations of metals, two coins and a spoon on each other
  - he felt a tingling sensationn, similar to discharge of leyden jar
  - he could taste the electricity, it must come from the metals
  - frog's leg twitch not cus of its own, but from the metal
  - his coins electricity was incredibly weak, how could he make it stronger?
  - reading paper's of cavendish on torpedo fish, repeating pattern on fish's body
  - building his own artificial version of torpedo fish
  - pile of metals as battery
  - the electricity from the pile/battery was continuous, not a shock

- electricity in water, separating H and O, born of chemistry

- 1808: humphrey davy: built the worlds largest battery
  - used it as light source

- 1812: michael faraday: attended a lecture of davy
  - started to work as assistant of davy
  - invisible forces of electricity and magnetism

- 1820: hans christian oersted
  - moving magnetic compass by charged copper rod
  - electric current can create magnetic force

- 1821: faraday experiment: convert electric current into continuous motion
  - the earliest ever electric motor

- 1831: faraday experiment: challenge himself to use magnetism and motion to make electricy
  - moving conducting copper plate through the magnetic field
  - generated a continuous flow of electric current
  - unlike battery his current flowed as long as his copper disc span
  - he created electrical power directly from mechanical power

- telegraph: electricity from lab to ordinary people

- william sturgeon & joseph henry: electromagnets
  - adding more coils in their current carrying wires they could make a more concentrated magnetic field
  - more coils, more turns, stronger the magnet
  - they could place certain kinds of metal inside the electromagnetic coil(iron)
  - electromagnet only works all the time there is a current passing through it
  - place magnet much further away at the end of a wire, suddenly you can make
    smth happen at your command

- this ability to control a magnet at a distance is one of the most useful
  things we have ever discovered

- 1840: samuel morse:

- 1858: atlantic cable was establish(faulty)
  - problem: 98 words long message took 16 hours to transmit
  - incrasing the voltage?
  - mostly belived electrical current flows like water in a pipe
  - but telegraph actually was carrying pulses or ripples of current along the cable
  - over the long distances, these pulses were becoming distorted, is a short dot vs long dash?
  - was not always flow like water but also creating invisible electromagnetic waves
  - leap: electromagnetic spectrum

- 1866: atlantic cable was establish(full functional)

- 1880: thomas edison: light: burning stuff -> gas -> electricity 
  - menlo park: word's first research and development facility
  - edison's dream: bring electric light to every home in the land
  - electric going through filament, but much harder to pass through than copper
  - born of resistence, more current, more heat, more resistence till glows
  - platinum: high melting point, stretched, more resistence, expensive, not enough resistence
  - built system to distribute electricity


- 1882: edison: 
  - taking cables from hanging above to underground for safety
  - cables underground for his direct current(DC)
  - putting cable everywhere to distribute electricity to rural areas was too costly
  - PROBLEM: with distributing direct current

- :tesla: was not impressed by edison's advancement
  - dream: electricity could be transmitted across entire cities/nations by using different type of electrict current
  - solution: alternating current
  - can alternating current be used for running a motor?

- 1888: george westinghouse: 

- : war of currents: AC/DC
  - AC cables carry high voltage, touching them could be deadly


- 1891: tesla:
  - demonstrated extremely high voltages could be safe

- 1896: power station producing AC

- james clark maxwell
  - before maxwell people built machines and experiments
  - he was interested in the numbers
  - he revealed electricity's invisible force field and how it could be manipulated
  - changing the direction of current could create waves

- 1887: heinrich hertz: maxwell's waves really exist?

- 1888: oliver lodge: saw glowing patches between wires by accident
  - they were peaks and troughs of a wave
  - electromagnetic waves

- 1894: lodge: ring experiment for detecting waves
  - a machine alternating current sending electrinoc waves
  - another machine with athena picks up the wave set the bell
  - telegraph without cables

- 1986: marconi

- : Bose: semiconductor crystals for detecting electromagnetic waves

- : william crookes: could the electric current pass through nothingness through the vacuum?
  - give electric current from one end, the other end of the tube shines
  - the beam is known as a *cathode ray*
  - same as Bose's semiconductor crystals, but not as much temperamental
  - this tubes could be manifactured consistenly
  - known as *valf*

- : valves was not good enough for better radar systems
  - back to semiconductors
  - *silicon*
  - valves as amplifiers: turning a very weak electrical signal into a much stronger one
  - small amplifiers replacing valves(by german)

- bell labs: transistor
  - neither german version nor bell labs version did not work reliably
  - by accident: generated voltage dependend on light in the room
  - one way junction in a crystal
  - o

- 1955: william shockley 

- 1986:  superconductor at low temprature
  - problem: electrons moves, creates heats, lots of heat
  - search for room-tempratur superconductor continues
