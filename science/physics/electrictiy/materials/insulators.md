# insulators

- materials which do not allow electric current to flow through them

- even though the electrons in an insulator can't jump from atom to atom, what
  it can do is, it can shift

- if so many electrons move to one side of the insulator, that can create an
  overall electrical effect where the insulator can interact with other changes nearby

- we can force-charge an insulator with electron, but it wont move, it will just stay where we put
