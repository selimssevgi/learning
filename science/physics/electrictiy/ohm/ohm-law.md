# ohm's law

- electric potential = electric current x resistency
- V = IR

- if tempurature increases
  - free electrons moves faster
  - then the resistence of a conductor will increase

- higher current, higher tempurature
- higher temperature, higher resistance
-

- the moment that the resistance R becomes a function of the temperature



- if resistence would go down, with higher temperature, then after some time lamb would be destroyed
  - current increase heat
  - heat decreases(!) resistance
  - current goes up
  - after some time, no resistance, light bulb explotion
  

## ions

- ionizing air or water decreases the resistance

- heating up the air(by fire, candle) or adding salt to water decreases the
  resistance of both
