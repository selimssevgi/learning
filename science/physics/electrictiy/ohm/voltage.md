# voltage

- voltage is what pushes the free electrons around a circuit

- without voltage, electrons move randomly in any direction

- imagine voltage like pressure in a water pipe
- the more voltage we have, the more current we have

- voltage can exist without current, we can measure it

- volt is the unit of voltage
  - voltage is energy per change/coulomb
  - voltage is joules per coulomb
  - 1 volt = 1 joule per coulomb

- there are two kinds of voltage

1. direct voltage: electrons moves in one direction
  - batteries
  - solar panels

2. alternating voltage: electrons also move in reverse direction
  - wall sockets
