# gravity


- *aristotle* had contended that two objects of different weights would fall to
  the ground at different speeds, with the heaviest object falling faster

- *galileo* dropped two balls to the ground below Pisa tower
  - balls have similar shape and density, but different masses
  - expected: bigger one falling first
  - observed: both hit the ground at the same time

item 1       | item 2       | ground | air
--------------------------------------------
basketball   | paper        | item 1 | yes
basketball   | tennis ball  | same   | yes
basketball   | footbal      | same   | yes
ball         | paper        | same   | no

- mass does not affect an object's acceleration

- when there is no air, heavy and light object hit the ground at the same time
  - object falling in vacoom

## what is gravity? (Newton)

- *newton* the force that cause apple to falling down is the same force that
  keep the moon in orbit around the earth 

- moon goes so fast but earth pulls it to itself, so moon is not fast enough to
  fall out of orbit, not slower that it could crash to earth

## law of universal gravitation

- F = G M1M2 / r^2

- when the gravitation force is too strong or too weak, it is not universal

- only in between (on the scale of the solar system), the law of gravitation reasonably applies

- how can it be wrong at a different scale?

- how world looks?
  - too close: bumpy
  - normal: flat
  - too far: round

- how gravity works:
  - too strong(black hole): general relativity
  - normal(solar): newton's law of gravitation
  - too weak(quantum): ??

## how it works (Einstein)

- newton's law describes the strength of gravity with great accuracy, but not how it works 

- einstein: nothing can go faster than light

* let's say sun suddenly got destroyed:

- newton:
  - the planets would immediately fly out of their orbits, move in space
  - gravity is a force acts instantenously, across any distance, so we would immediately feel the effect of the sun destruction

- einstein:
  - light does not travel instantenously, it takes 8 mins for sun light to reach earth
  - nothing, not even gravity can travel faster light
  - then how earth would fly out immediately?
