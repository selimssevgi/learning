# mass

- mass is not a property of material substance.
- it is not something that matter has.

- mass is a behavior of quantum fields. it is what quantom fields do.

- mass is amount of matter present in the object

- image same object on on earth and on moon
  - will the mass be different?
  - will the amount of matter in the object be different?

- the mass of an object is constant no matter where it is placed

- mass is a measure of its inertia
- greater the mass of an object, greater will be its inertia

- inertia: tendency of an object to resist change in its state of motion

## weight

- weight is the measure of the gravitational pull on an object

- F = ma (replace acceleration with g)
- F = mg (acceleration due to gravity)


## history

- "nothing comes into being out of what is non-existent" -- epicurus

- "nature resolves everything into its component atoms and never reduces anything to nothing" -- lucretius

- "since the atoms are moving freely through the void they must all be kept in motion by their weight" -- lucretius

- newton: mechanical atom
- john dalton: chemical atoms (water = h20)
- rutherford: atomic/nuclear physics (99% of mass is in nucleus)
- : quantum mechanics
- richard feynman: quantum field theory
