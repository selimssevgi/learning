# four forces

- electromagnetism
- strong nuclear force
- weak nuclear force
- gravity


## electromagnetism

- is the force that holds electrons in place around nucleus
- holds the atoms and molecules
- causes electrons to repel each other

## strong nuclear force

- in nucleus, protons repel each other
- there must be another force many times stronger than electromagnetism that
  glues the nucleus together

## weak nuclear force

- convert protons into neutrons, or neutrons into protons
