# gravitational time dilation

- *newton* saw space and time as independent fixed and immutable
- the 3-dimensional space is the stage in which things happen
- but time is separate, it ticks by at the same rate everywhere in the universite

- according to the newton: one object would travel through space in a straight
  line unless acted upon by a force like gravity

- newton's gravity: an invisible string pulling object together

- *einstein* said that space and time aren't fixed and immutable, they are
  interconnected, as spacetime

- matter curves space and time around it

- earth warps the structure of space and time around it

- space and time can't be disentangled
- you can't talk about space separately from time

- gravity slows time down

- gravity does curve space itself
