- the speed of light is a constant for all observers

- there is no such thing as absolute rest or absolute motion

- everything is relative

- time would be different for observer inside and outside of moving vehicle 

- time runs slower on earth's surface than it does aboe the atmosphere

- you are slower when you move faster

### law of relativity

- until 8 mins later, the earth does not know that the sun has dissappeared

- if there is a black hole in universe, it will not immediately attract every
  object, this object does not yet know that the black hole exists, they cannot
  react to smth, they dont know


### time buble

-  let's say there is an explosion

- 5 seconds after the explosion, the radius of this time buble will be five light seconds
  - for everyone inside the buble, the explosion has happened
  - for everyone outside the buble, the explosion hasn't yet happened

- 10 seconds later, the diameter is 10 light seconds, then person B notice the explosion

- our perspective of universive depends on where we are

- this idea contradict newton's idea of a universal stage whereas one thing
  happens, it happens for everybody

## applicaitons

- statllite moves so fast around the earth

- their clocks are programmed with correction factors to account for
  relativistic effects and remain in sync with earth

- time dilation does not only affect mechanical clocks but biological clocks as well
