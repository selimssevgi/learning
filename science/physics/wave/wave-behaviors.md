# wave behaviors

1. transmission
2. reflection
3. refraction
4. diffranction
5. absorption
6. scattering

## transmission

- waves keep traveling in the same direction through an object
- like light through a window

## reflection

- when waves bounce off an object
- sound waves are reflected by hard flat surfaces
- echo: sound waves have to travel twice as far to reach your ears


## absorption

- white light contains each wavelength
- the color of an object depends on which wavelengtht of light it absorbs

- white objects reflect all the light there hits them and absorbs none
- black objects reflect none and instead absorb all the light

## refraction

- when sound and light waves pass across a boundary between two substances like
  air and glass, they change speed, that is because the substances have different densities

- change in speed causes the waves to change direction, which is known as refraction

## diffraction

- when waves meet a gap in a barrier they pass through the gap, then they spread back out
