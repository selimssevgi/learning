# asymptotic notation

- what does it mean an algorith efficient/fast?

- hardware, or other running program, any other impact from environment does not affect this calculation


- how fast a program's runtime grows asymptotically

- the size of your inputs increases towards infinity, how does the runtime of your program grow?

- we have good ways to reason about codes efficiency without knowing anything
  about the real-world time they take to run
