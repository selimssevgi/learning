# 6.006 - Lecture 03 - Insertion, Merge Sort

- Why sorting?
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort (Divide & Conquer)
- Recurrences solving

## Why Sorting?

- Obvious, phone book, music etc
- Problems that become easy once items are sorted
- Finding a median
- array, unsorted: A[0:n] -> sorted: B[0:n], median: B[n/2]
- Binary search could be applied: O(lgn)

- Not so obvious application
- data compression, sort, find dups, frequency-item
- computer graphics, sorting scenes
