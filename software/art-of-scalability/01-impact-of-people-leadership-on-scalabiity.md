# ch-01 - the impact of people and leadership on scalability

## why people

- we are going to go out on a limb and assert that people are the most important aspect of scale

- without people there is no need for systems that need scaling

- who would design and implement the system if no people?

- right person, right behavior

## why organization

- adding and removing people to organization should be easy process

- an important point to remember here is that as you add people, although the
  total output of the team increases, the average output per person tends to go
  down slightly (communication overhead)

- the structure should not stand in the way to measure organizational and individual output


- operation team, development team, QA team
  - how to measure the productivity?
  - who is slowing down the work?

- who is responsible for ensuring that the product or platform has an
  appropriate level of scale for our needs?

- who is responsible for identifying and resolving issues of scale?

## why management and leadership

- in general and at a very high level, you can think of management activities as
  "pushing" activities and leadership as "pulling" activities

- leadership: "we will never have a saclability related downtime in our system"
  - sets the destination
- management: would ensure that it never happens
  - takes you to the destination

- management means measurement and a failure to measure is a failure to manage

- leadership is important to scale as it is not only sets the dreiction(mission)
  and destionation(vision) but it inspires people and organizations to achieve
  that destination
