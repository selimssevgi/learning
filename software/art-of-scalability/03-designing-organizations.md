# ch03 - designing organizations

- factors that an org structure can influence and show how those are also key
  factors in an application's or web service's scalability

- there are two determinants of an organization:

1. team size
2. team structure

## organizational influences that affect scalability

- communication (spamming, missing important parts)
- efficiency (developer wait for PO to answer question via email or sit next to each other)
- standards (with reasoning, no solo work without a reason)
- quality
- ownership (too many people on a code base, nobody cares)

## team size

- 6 < team-size < 15

- more people is more problematic for a less experinced manager

- the experience level of people in the company in the engineering
  - more experience less overhead

- if most of the engineers are experienced enough, time size can grow
  - they can work with less overhead of communication

* managerial responsibilities:
  - engineers are assigned to projects
  - administrative tasks take place
  - status updates are passed along

- speaking frequently with team members is critical to be an effective manager and leader


### warning signs for team size

* if a team is too large:
  - poor communication
  - lowered productivity
  - poor morale (many reasons, like debugging, look what changed recently?)
    - showing up late for work
    - spending more time in the game room
    - arguing more in meetings
    - pushing back more than usual on executive level decisions


* if a team is too small:
  - disgruntled business partners
  - micromanaging managers
  - overworked team members

## organizational structure

- functional and maxtrix structures

### functional organization

- armies and industries

- VP of eng (developer)
- VP of QA (tester)
- VP of product mgmt (PM)

- the managers climb to top, they know the job
- easily maintained applied standards

- no single project owner
- poor cross-functional communication
- most projects always require tasks to be accomplished by multiple teams

### maxrix organization

- two managers unlike functional org where there is one manager
  - administrative manager
  - project manager

- many members of each team can belong to project teams

- a team consists of members from each functional group
  - better communication
  - project ownership


- solution introduces another problem:
  - reporting two managers
  - distraction from main discipline

- managers could have conflicting requests (engineering and project)
  - apply standards and best practices(EM)
  - finish on time (PM)



- the key here is to use the organizational structure to solve your problems that exist today
- there isn o single reight answer that is right for all companies at all times
