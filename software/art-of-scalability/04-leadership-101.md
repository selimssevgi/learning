# ch-04 leadership 101

- if you can't lead, you can't scale

- leadership isn't a destination
- it is a journey without an end and you of course are the lader of your individual journey

## what is leadership?

- influencing the behavior of an organization or a person to accomplish a specific objective

- pulling activities

- the establishment of a vision that inspires an organization "pulls" that org to the goal or objective

## leadership - a conceptual model

- "perception is reality"

- "leaders are under a microscope"

- review process is important

- improvement plan from reviews

## leading from the front

- when it comes to behaviors, you should show your team that you aren't asking
  them to do anything that you dont do now!

## checking your ego at the door

- "smartest person in the room"

- "i am right more often than I am wrong"

- be more team oriented than self oriented

## mission first, people always

- Mission First - reports may not follow them

- Mission First, Me always - reports most likely not follow them

- mission first, people always - reports most likely follow them

## making timely, sound, and morally correct decisions

- what you allow you teach and what you teach becomes your standard

- never start

- dont take company pens

## empowering teams and scalability

- not on paper

- telling them do it, and reviewing and requiring approval for everything will work in disasterous way

## alignment with shareholder value

## vision (destination)

- vivid description of an ideal future

- important to value creation

- measurable

- inspirational

- incorporate elements of your beliefs

- mostly static but modifiable as the need presents itself

- easily remembered

## mission (journey)

- general path or actions

- present state so we can get to the "desired state"(vision)

- be descriptive of the present state and action

- incorporate a sense of purpose

- be measurable

- include a general direction or path toward the vision

## goals

- vision: description of where we are going
- mission: general direction how to get there
- goals: guideposts or mile markers to ensure that we are on track

- SMART goals are:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Attainable (but aggressive)
- Realistic
- Timely (or contain a component of time)


- remember that goals dont tell somehow *how* to do someting but rather they
  give them an indication that they are on track


- explaining or defining a path to a goal or vision is a management activity

## the causal roadmap to success

- as a leader help people understand how what they do every day contributes to
  the vision of the organization and as a result the creation of shareholder value
