# ch08 - managing incidents and problems

- recurring incidents are the enemy of scalability

- our recent incidents and problems are very likely great incidications of our
  current and future limitation

## what is an incident?

- any event that reduces the quality of our service

- *issue management* is to restore normal operations as quickly as possible

- management of an issue really becomes the management of the impact of the issue

## what is a problem?

- the unknown cause of one or more incidents, often identified as a result of
  multiple similar incidents

- known error

- objective of *problem management* is to minimize the impact of problems on the organization



- incident management: restoration of service
- problem management: the identification and resolution of root cause

## the components of incident management

- incident detection and recording
- classification and initial support
- investigation and diagnosis
- resolution and recovery
- incident closure
- incident ownership, monitoring, tracking, and communication


- incident detection is all about the monitoring of your systems

- designing a system to be monitored is necessary but not sufficient to identify
  and resolve incidents quickly

## the components of problem management

## implementing the daily incident meeting

## the postmortem process

- can help identify issues related to process and training

- it should not be used as a forum for finger pointing

- the size of incident or group of incidents for postmortem?

- we want to use the postmortem on items that have hugely and negatively impacted us
  - not for all incidents, it would take valueable creative time

- timeline phase
  - critical dates, times, and actions
  - no problems or issues should be identified or debated

- issue phase
  - what is missing in timeline data?
  - what additional data would be useful?
  - just log the issues, no discussion about the issues
  - no reference to ownership, no blaming
  - another pass over the list if needed

- action phase
  - define actions to fix the issues
  - owners should be assigned for each task
