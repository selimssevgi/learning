# ch09 - managing crisis and escalations

## what is a crisis?

- losing a leg is absolutely worse than losing a finger, but both require
  immediate medical attention

- crisis or series of crises can serve as the catalyst for change

## order out of chaos

- if you cannot effectively manage the force you throw at a crisis, you are
  better off using fewer people

## the role of the "problem manager"

- outage commander, problem manager, incident manager, crisis commando

- ensure that you have at least one person on your staff who has the skills to
  manage such a chaotic environment

- the person absolutely needs to be technically literate but not necessarily the
  most technical person in the room

- he does not need to be the chief problem solver, but he needs to effectively
  manage the process of the chief problem solvers gathered within the crisis
