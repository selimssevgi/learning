# ch06 - making the business case

## understanding the experiential chasm

- the problem between many general managers and their technical teams

- technical manager(complete project, ship on time) vs general manager(closing deal, sales person)
  - the mismatch in education and experience

- resulting mismatch in communication often gives way to a more destructive form
  of communication, which we call *destructive interference*

## why the business executive might be the problem

## why the technology executive might be the problem

## defeating the corporate mindset

- lots of companies claim that technology is a key differentiator

- in reality many of them treat technology as a support service

- there are two basic forms:
  - to be a support service where technology supports the business processes
  - to be the product for the business: IaaS, hardware products, Web 2.0 companies


- cost center vs profit center

- *corporate mindset* because most very large corporations whose primary
  business is not technology have the view as "support service/cost center"

- eBay, PayPay, Amazon, Google were founded on the technology
- these companies should understand in their DNA that the technology is the business


- take responsibility into your own hands and make the organization the type of
  place that you want it to be:

1. form relationships
2. set the example
3. educate other executives
4. use the RASCI model
5. speak in business terms
6. get them involved
7. scare the executive team with facts

## the business case for scale

- downtime equals lost revenue
