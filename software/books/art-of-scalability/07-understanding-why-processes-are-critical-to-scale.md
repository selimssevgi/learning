# ch07 - understanding why processes are critical to scale

## the purpose of process

- people, methods, and tools

- processes allow your teams to react quickly to crisis, determine the root cause of failures

- one of the principle of processes:
  - to manage people when the manager is not available
  - or it is not cost-effective for manager to spend time providing the same
    guidance to team over and over for the same task

- good process supplements management and augments its reach

- without a clear process, there is room for everyone to make their own decisions

- two key reasons that we create and maintain processes are:
  - the standardization of how to perfom tasks
  - what to do in the event of procedural uncertainty

## right time, right process

- every company is different

- even the same company is different than two years ago

## how much rigor

- improving the process

- signs:
  - constantly managing people through certain tasks
  - every engineer seems to be doing the same task differently
  - employees are being overly burdened by mundane stuff

## how complex

- start simple, improve over time

## when good processes go bad

- processes can issues themselves

- the result of breaucracy as you might expect is lowered productivity and poorer morale
