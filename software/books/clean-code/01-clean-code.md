# Clean Code

- Abstraction level will increase
- There will always be code
- Wont be machine taking care of all the coding

## Bad Code

- LeBlanc's law: Later equals never

## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess

- Slowed down by messy code
- Have to understand every bit to add more bits

- the messier code gets the more people join the team, productivity goes to zero

## The Grand Redesing in the Sky

- there is a messy
- a new grand redesign is started
- takes a lot time,, original members of the redesign leaves
- new members ask for a new design

- spending time keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it's a
  matter of professional survival.

## Attitude

- what if you were a doctor and ad a patient who demanded that you stop all the
  silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time?

- Clearly the patient is the boss (the manager)
- yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply.
- Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and
  infection.

- So it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who
  dont understand the risks of making messes.

- Boy Scout Rule: Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
