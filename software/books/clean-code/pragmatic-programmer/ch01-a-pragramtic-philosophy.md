# ch01 - a pragmatic phisolophy

- always trying to place it in its larger context, always trying to be aware of the bigger picture

- they take responsibility for everything they do

- pragmatic programmers wont sit idly by and watch their projects fall apart through neglect

## the cat ate my source code

- things go wrong whatever what, take responsibility and deal with them professionally

- this means being honest and direct

- we can be proud of our abilities, but we must be honest about our shortcomings

* How do you react when someone, such as a bank teller, atm or a clerk, comes to
  you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them and their company as a result?

## software entropy

- entropy is a term from physics that refers to the amount if "disorder" in a system
  - the laws of thermo-dynamics guarantee that the entropy in the universe tends toward a maximum

- when disorder increases in software, programmers call it "software rot"

- a broken window

* help strengthen your team by surveying your computing "neighborhood". choose
  two or three "broken windows" and discuss with your colleagues what the
  problems are and what could be done to fix them

* Can you tell when a windown first gets broken? What is your reaction? If it
  was the result of someone else's decision, or a management edict, what can you
  do about it?

## stone soup and boiled frogs

- soldiers goes to a village after war, noone helps
- soldiers start to cook stone soup
- villagers ask "that is it?", the soup would taste better with that and this
- villagers brings carrots, potatoes etc
- take out the stone at the end, enjoy the soup all together

- the soldiers act as a catalyst, bringing the village together so they can
  jointly produce something that they couldn't have done by themselves

- in broken window, people lose the will to fight entropy because they perceive
  that one else cares. The frog just does't notice the change

* Can you determine whether you're making stone soup or frog soup when you try
  to catalyze change? Is the decision subjective or objective?

## good-enough software

- U.S. company places an order for 100,000 integrated circuits with a Japanaese manufacturer
- part of the specification was the defect rate: one chip in 10.000
- a few weeks later the order arrived:
  - one large box containing thousands of ICs
  - a small box containing just ten - labels with "these are the faulty ones"

- many users would rather use software with some rough edges 'today' than wait a
  year for the multimedia version

- artists will tell you that all the hard work is ruined if you don't know when
  to stop, if you add layer upon layer, detail over detail, the painting becomes
  lost in the paint

## your knowledge portfolio

> an investment in knowledge always pays the best interest -- benjamin franklin

- your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets

- unfortunately, they are expiring assets, your knowledge becomes out of date as
  new techniques, languages, and environments are developed

- managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfoio:

1. serious investors invest regularly -- as a habit

2. diversification is the key to long-term success
  - the more different things you know, the more valuable you are
  - as a baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of the particular technology you are working with currently

3. smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments

4. investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return
  - learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as
    hard as finding an undervalued stock, but payoff can be just as rewarding

5. portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically

- here are few suggestions:

* learn at least one new language every year
* read a technical book each quarter
* read nontechnical books, too
* take classes
* participate in local user groups
* experiment with different environments

### critical thinking

- ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or media hype

- never underestimate the power of commercialism
  - web engine can be paid to list as first
  - bookstore can be paid to feature the book

## communicate

- a good idea is an orphan without effective communication

- WISDOM acrostic -- understanding an audience
