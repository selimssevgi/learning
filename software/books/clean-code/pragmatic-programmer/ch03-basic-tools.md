# ch03 the basic tools

- tools amplify your talent

- the better your tools, and the better you know how to use them, the more
  productive you can be

## the power of plain text

- plain text does not mean that the text is unstructured
  - xml, html etc

- the problem with most binary formats is that the context necessary to
  understand the data is separate from the data itself

- with plain text, you can achieve a self-descibing data stream that is
  independent of the application that created it

* drawback: more space, more computer power to process

## shell games

- a benefit of gui is "what you see is what you get"
- the disadvantage of gui is "what you see is ALL you get"

## power editing

- use an editor and use it well

## source code control

## debugging

- the best way to start fixing a bug is to make it reproducible
  - if cannot produce it, how will you know if it is ever fixed?

- tracing (printing logs)

- rubber ducking

## text manipulation

- learn a text manipulation language(sed, awk or smth else)

## code generators

- there are 2 main types of code generators:

1. passive code generators: run once, divorced from the code generator

2. active code generators: used each time their results are required, the result
   is a throw-away, it can always be reproduced by the code generator
