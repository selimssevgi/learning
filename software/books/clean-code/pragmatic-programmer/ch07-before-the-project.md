# ch07 - before the project

- at the very beginning of a project, you will need to determine the requirements

- starting too soon is one problem, but waiting too long may be even worse

## the requirements pit

- dont gather requirements -- dig for them

- the distinctions among requirements, policy, and implementation can get very
  blurred when user interfaces are discussed

- documenting the reasons behind requirements will give your team invaluable
  information when making daily implementation decisions

- work with a user to think like a user

- one way of looking at use cases is to emphasize their goal-driven nature

- good requirements documents remain abstract

- abstractions live longer than details

## solving impossible puzzles

- some constraints are *absolute*, others are merely *preconceived notions*

- "thinking outside the box", where/what is the box?

- it is not whether you think inside the box or outside the box. the problem
  lies in finding the box -- identifying the real constraints

## not until you are ready

- great performers share a trait: they know when to start and when to wait

- listen to nagging doubts -- start when you are ready

- software development is still not a science, let your instincts contribute to your performance

- so how can you tell when you are simply procrastinating, rather than
  responsibly waiting for all the pieces to fall into place?

- PROTOTYPE!

- fear-of-starting?

## the specification trap

- writing a specification is quite a responsibility

- some things are better done than described

- distrust the environments where requirements are gathered, specifications are
  written, and then coding starts, all in isolation

- specification and implementation are simply different aspects of the same
  process, an attempt to capture and codify a requirement

## circles and arrows

- blindly adopting any technique without putting it into the context of your
  development practices and capabilities is a recipe for disappointment

- dont be a slave to formal methods
