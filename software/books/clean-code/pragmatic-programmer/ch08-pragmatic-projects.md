# ch08 - pragmatic projects

## pragmatic teams

- teams as a whole should not tolerate broken windows

- team must take responsibility for the quality of the product, supporting
  developers who understand the no broken windows philosophy

- it is a mistake to think that the activities of a project -- analysis, design,
  coding and testing -- can happen in isolation, they can't

- organize around functionality, not job functions

- each team knows that they alone are responsible for a particular function, so
  they feel more ownership of their output

## ubiquitous automation

- dont use manual procedures

## ruthless testing

- test early. test often. test automatically

- coding aint done til all the tests run

## it's all writing

- treat english as just another programming language

## great expectations

- gently exceed your users' expectations

## pride and prejudice

- sign your work
