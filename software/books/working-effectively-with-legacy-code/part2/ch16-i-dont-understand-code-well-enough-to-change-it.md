### notes/sketching

- when reading through code gets confusing, it pays to start drawing pictures and making notes

- write down the nameo f the last important thing that you saw, and then write
  down name of the next one.

- one of the best techniques for learning about code is refactoring

- just check out a copy of the project, play around, never check in

- scratch refactoring is great way of getting down to the essentials and really
  learning how a piece of code works
