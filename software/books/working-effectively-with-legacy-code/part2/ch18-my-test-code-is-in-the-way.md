# ch18 - my test code is in the way

- you may end up with lots of end, and get confused if browsing test code or production code


### class naming conventions

- DbEngine -> DbEngineTest
  - if the ide lists classes alphabetically, each class lines up next to its test class


### test location

- keeping prod and test code together can be problematic: size constraints

- keeping them to far away from each other can cause navigation problem

- src ve test directories, having convention and script to help you to have advantages of both ways
