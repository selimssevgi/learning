# ch02 - meaningful names

## use intention-revealing names

- with simple names, it is not difficult to understand what's going on

## avoid disinformation


```shell
In one case the author of the code suggested using a different font so that the differences were more obvious,
 a solution that would have to be passed down to all future developers as oral tradition or in a written document.
 The problem is conquered with finality and without creating new work products by a simple renaming.
```

## make meaningful distinctions

- Product, ProductInfo, ProductData?

## use pronounceable names

## use searchable names

## avoid encoding

- phoneString, phoneNumber, types changes but name stays

- member prefixes, m_dsc

- interfaces and implementations: IShapeFactory, ShapeFactoryImpl

## avoid mental mapping

## class names

## pick one word per concept

- fetch, retrieve, get

## use solution domain names

- AccountVisitor, JobQueue

## use problem domain names
