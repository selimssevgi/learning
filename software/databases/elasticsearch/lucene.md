# Lucene

- The indexing and search library for a high performance, full-text search engine

- it is a search library, provides no crawling and parsing capability of documents

- Just like Hadoop in the distributed computing world, Lucene is the nucleus of
  several technologies built aroun it


* Apache Solr: a 'search server' with: distributed indexing, load balancing,
  replication, automated recover, centralized configuration

* Apache Nutch: web crawling and index parsing

* CreateDB: open source, SQL distributed database, built on top of lucene

* Elasticsearch: distributed search and analytics engine which runs on Lucene
