## ADT vs DT

- Abstract Data Type vs Data Structure
- Algebraic data types?

- ADT is a logical description and data structure is concrete.

- ADT is the logical picture of the data and the operations to manipulate the
  component elements of the data.
- Data structure is the actual representation of the data during the implementation
  and the algorithms to manipulate the data elements.

- ADT is in the logical level and data structure is in the implementation level.

## Abstract Data Types

- Mathematical model for data types
- A data types is defined by its behavior from pov of a user

- an ADT specifies *what* each operations does, but not *how* it does it

- in java, an ADT can be expressed by an *interface*

## Data Structure

- Concrete representations of data
- Point of view of an implementer, not a user
