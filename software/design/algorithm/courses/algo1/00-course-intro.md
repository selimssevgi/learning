# Course Overview

- *Algorithm:*      method for solving a problem
- *Data structure:* method to store information

topic | data structures and algorithms
------|-----------------------------------------------
data types | stack, queue, bag, union-find, priority queue
sorting    | quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, radix sort
searching  | BST, red-black BST, hash table
graphs     | BFS, DFS, Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra
strings    | KMP, regex, TST, Huffman, LZW
advanved   | B-tree, suffix array, maxflow


## Steps to developing usable algorithms

- Model the problem
- Find an algorithm to solve it
- Fast enough? Fits in memory?
- If not, figure it why
- Find a way to address the problem
- Iterate until satisfied
