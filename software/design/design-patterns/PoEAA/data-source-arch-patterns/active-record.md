# Active Record

- An object that wraps a row in a db table or view, encapsulates the db access,
  and adds domain logic on that data.

- Active Record uses the most obvious approach, putting data access logic in the
  domain object.

- Active Record is very similar to Row Data Gateway.

- The principal difference is that a RDG contains only db access while an AR
  contains both data source and domain logic.

- Active Record couples the object design to the database design.
