# Patterns

- Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our env,
and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that
you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same
way twice.

- Patterns create a vocabulary about design, which is why naming is such an important issue.

- Patterns are a starting point, not a final destination.
