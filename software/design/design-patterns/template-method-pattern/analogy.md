# Analogy from spring-in-action

- while having flight, the lagguage goes from point A to B

- you just give it to them at the beginning, and claim at the end

- in the middle, it will put on the plane, get out of the plane
- or even be transfered if you have a connecting flight

- even though there are many steps to this process, you are actively involved in only a couple of them
- the carrier is responsible for driving the process
- you are involved only when you need to be; the rest is taken care of

- this mirrors template method pattern
