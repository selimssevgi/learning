# The architecture of service discovery

- These four general concepts are shared across all service discovery implementations:


1. Service registration: How does a service register itself?

2. Client lookup of service address

3. Infomation sharing: How is service information shared across nodes?

4. Health monitoring: How do services communicate their health back the service discovery agent?
