# Maven Best Practices

- grouping common dependencies

- can be done using a second separate POM file

- allows other projects to reuse this file

- choosing inheritance vs. multi-module


- multi-module -- used when components are unrelated

- inheritance  -- used when projects share dependencies

- proper indentation for the pom.xml file

- follow a standard layout where coordinates are listed first
