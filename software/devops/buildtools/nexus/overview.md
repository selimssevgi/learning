# Nexus Overview


## Benefit 1

- If your build relies directly on maven central, you are missing an opportunity

- you are wasting time and bandwidth if you have 5,10,100 developers, you are
  downloading the same artifacts over and over again

- Nexus is pre-configured with a proxy from Maven Central

- You can use Nexus with Ant, Gradle, or Maven

## Benefit 2

- How do you deal with third-party jars?

- The 3rd-party libs that are not available in Maven Central?

- Check the jars in source control? (bad solution)

- Instead upload it to a repository that has the same structure as the Maven
  Central repository

- That is what Nexus brings to the table

## Benefit 3

- Host your own artifacts if you generate applications or libraries

- Share your own artifacts between groups and departments

- Nexus is the best way to do this



* Nexus has open sourced and professional versions
