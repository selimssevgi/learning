# Networking Basics

- protocols
- network interfaces
- ports

## Protocol

- A protocol with respect to communication and networking is a sort of language

- HTTP: the protocol that provides the WWW

## Network Interface

- A network interface has an address and represents a location

- As analogous to real-world locations with addresses

- A network interface is like a mailbox

- Whereas a mailbox has a postal address, a network interface has an IP address

- It's common for computers to have two kinds of interfaces

1. Ethernet interface

2. A loopback interface

### Ethernet Interface

- Is used to connect to other interfaces and process

### Loopback Interface

- Is not connected to any other interface

- Is often useful to be able to use network protocols to communicate with other
  programs on the same computer

## Port

- A port is like a recipient or a sender

- There might be several people who receive messages at a single address

- Ports are written on TCP messages just like names are written on envelopes


## Networks

- Interfaces are single points in larger networks

- Networks are defined in the way that interfaces are linked together, and that
  linkage determines an interface's IP address
