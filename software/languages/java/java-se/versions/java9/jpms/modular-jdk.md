# Modular JDK

- Before Java 9, the java runtime and library consisted of one big lib: rt.jar

- One huge library
- Many entangled classes
- Hard to evolve
- Restricted by backward-compatibility

## Advantages

- Increased security (strong encapsulation)

- Reduced footprint(smaller rt.jar)

- Easy deprecation

- Future proof (experimental future: jdk.incubator)
