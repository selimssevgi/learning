# React Native New Project

- 'create-react-native-app' is the old way, use expo-cli instead.

```shell
npm install -g expo-cli
expo init project-name
cd project-name
npm start
```

- Download the expo app from application store on your mobile

- Scan the QR and give it a litle time to load

- If this is not the first app, expo loads the earlier app, after a change on
  the new project, you will see the new one.

- shake the phone in order to see 'developer menu'
