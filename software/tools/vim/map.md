# Mapping in Vim

- Mapping enables you to bind a set of Vim commands to a single key

## Example

```vim
:map <F5> i{<Esc>ea}<Esc>
```

- F5 is the trigger key, causes the command to be executed
- i{ goes insert mode and types {
- Esc leaves insert mode
- e moves to the end of the word
- a goes insert mode and appends }
- Esc leaves insert mode

## List of Mappings

- :map  - lists all the mappings.
- :mkvimrc file
