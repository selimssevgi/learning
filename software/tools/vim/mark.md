# Marks

- A mark is set to any cursor location using the m command

- Each mark is designated by a single lower case letter
- Thus ma sets the 'a' mark to the current location, and mz sets the 'z' mark

- You can move to the line containing a mark using the ' (single quote) command.
- Thus 'a moves to the beginning of the line containing the 'a' mark.

- You can move to the precise location of any mark using the ` (backquote) command.
- Thus `z will move directly to the exact location of the 'z' mark.

```shell
ma                     # mark the line with 'a'
'a                     # move to the line marked with 'a'
```
