# Search

```shell
/include       # search 'include' in the rest of the text
n              # to find the next 'include'
:set hlsearch  # highlight the found words
:nohls         # in order to get rid of highlighting
:set incsearch # vim does incremental search, start searching as soon as you start typing
```

- to escape special characters use backward slash. \. \?
