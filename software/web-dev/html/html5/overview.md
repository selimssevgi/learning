# HTML5 Overview

- HTML5 is the newest version of HTML

- It introduces simplified tags, new semantic and media elements, and relies on
  a set of JS libraries that enable web application(state, interactivity)

- XHTML is no longer the standard for web pages

- Developers and the W3C decided to keep extending and improving HTML instead

- The new, simpler HTML6 doctype is supported by older browsers, the use
  standards mode when they see this doctype

- The type attribute is no longer needed in the script tag or in a stylesheet to
  link CSS. JS and CSS are now the defaults

- The meta tag used for specifying the character set has been simplified to
  include only the character encoding

- UTF-8 is now the standard charset in use on the Web

- HTML5's new elements are a superset of HTML4 elements, which means older pages
  will continue to work in modern browsers

- Many of the new features in HTML5 require JS to make the most of them
