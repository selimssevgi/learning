# HTML5 Template

- CSS has been declared the standard, and default, style for HTML5

- JavaScript is now the standard and default scripting language for HTML5

- so no need to include 'type' attribute to neither of their tags

- It works with old browsers in this way, because the already have assumed these defaults

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```
