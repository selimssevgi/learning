# curtains

## curtain rods

- not too narrow
  - should be a little wider than the outer frame of the window
  - when curtains are open they are gonna be gathered in front of the wall (make windows looks bigger than they are )


## curtain panels

- not too short curtain panels
- 4 types:
  - kiss (hard to get)
  - puddle (dramatic effect, needs frequent cleaning)
  - floating (clean look)
